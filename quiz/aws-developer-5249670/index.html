It can capture, transform, and deliver streaming data to Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, Amazon Elasticsearch Service, generic HTTP endpoints, and service providers like Datadog, New Relic, MongoDB, and Splunk. It is a fully managed service that automatically scales to match the throughput of your data and requires no ongoing administration. It can also batch, compress, transform, and encrypt your data streams before loading, minimizing the amount of storage used and increasing security.\n\nAmazon Kinesis Data Analytics is the easiest way to transform and analyze streaming data in real-time with Apache Flink. Apache Flink is an open source framework and engine for processing data streams. Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics reduces the complexity of building, managing, and integrating Apache Flink applications with other AWS services.\n\nAmazon Kinesis Data Analytics provides built-in functions to filter, aggregate, and transform streaming data for advanced analytics. It processes streaming data with sub-second latencies, enabling you to analyze and respond to incoming data and events in real-time.\n\nAmazon Kinesis Data Analytics is serverless; there are no servers to manage.

The data collected is available in milliseconds to enable real-time analytics use cases such as real-time dashboards, real-time anomaly detection, dynamic pricing, and more.\n\nKinesis Data Streams needs manual provisioning of shards and a planning of shard requirements. The use-case clearly states that the company wants a fully managed solution as soon as possible with minimal effort.

The KCL handles complex issues such as adapting to changes in data stream volume, load balancing streaming data, coordinating distributed services, and processing data with fault-tolerance. The KCL enables you to focus on business logic while building applications.\n\nIf you want a fully managed solution and you want to use SQL to process the data from your data stream, you should use Kinesis Data Analytics. Use KCL if you need to build a custom processing solution whose requirements are not met by Kinesis Data Analytics, and you can manage the resulting consumer application.\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eUse Kinesis Firehose to ingest data and Amazon Athena to generate leaderboard scores and time-series analytics\u003c/strong\u003e - Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL.

In this case, the backend web host is configured in a stage variable so that when developers call your production endpoint, API Gateway calls example.com. When you call your beta endpoint, API Gateway uses the value configured in the stage variable for the beta stage, and calls a different web host (for example, beta.example.com).

You save money going with Reserved instances vs on-demand especially in a year's worth of time.\n\nReserved Instances are not physical instances, but rather a billing discount applied to the use of On-Demand Instances in your account. These On-Demand Instances must match certain attributes, such as instance type and Region, to benefit from the billing discount. So, there is no performance difference between an On-Demand instance or a Reserved instance.\n\nHow RIs work:\n\u003cimg src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-dva-pt/assets/pt5-q60-i1.jpg\"\u003e\nvia - \u003ca href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-reserved-instances.html\"\u003ehttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-reserved-instances.html\u003c/a\u003e\n\nIncorrect options:\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmazon EC2 Spot Instances\u003c/strong\u003e - A Spot Instance is an unused EC2 instance that is available for less than the On-Demand price. Because Spot Instances enable you to request unused EC2 instances at steep discounts, you can lower your Amazon EC2 costs significantly. Spot instances are useful if your applications can be interrupted, like data analysis, batch jobs, background processing, and optional tasks. Spot instances can be pulled down anytime without prior notice. Hence, not the right choice for the current scenario.\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmazon EC2 On-Demand Instances\u003c/strong\u003e - With On-Demand Instances, you pay for compute capacity by the second with no long-term commitments. You have full control over its lifecycle—you decide when to launch, stop, hibernate, start, reboot, or terminate it. But, On-Demand instances cost a lot more than Reserved instances. Here, in our use case, we already know that the systems are required for a complete year, so making use of Reserved Instances discount makes a lot more sense.\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eOn-premise EC2 instance\u003c/strong\u003e - On-premise implies the client has to maintain the physical machines, their capacity provisioning and maintenance.
