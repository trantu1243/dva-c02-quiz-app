f:T996,Correct option:

<strong>Create an IAM role in account B with access to DynamoDB. Modify the trust policy of the role in Account B to allow the execution role of Lambda to assume this role. Update the Lambda function code to add the AssumeRole API call</strong>

You can give a Lambda function created in one account ("account A") permissions to assume a role from another account ("account B") to access resources such as DynamoDB or S3 bucket. You need to create an execution role in Account A that gives the Lambda function permission to do its work. Then you need to create a role in account B that the Lambda function in account A assumes to gain access to the cross-account DynamoDB table. Make sure that you modify the trust policy of the role in Account B to allow the execution role of Lambda to assume this role. Finally, update the Lambda function code to add the AssumeRole API call.

Sample use-case to configure a Lambda function to assume a role from another AWS account:

<strong>Create a clone of the Lambda function in AWS Account B so that it can access the DynamoDB table in the same account</strong> - Creating a clone of the Lambda function is a distractor as this does not solve the use-case outlined in the problem statement.

<strong>Add a resource policy to the DynamoDB table in AWS Account B to give access to the Lambda function in Account A</strong> - You cannot attach a resource policy to a DynamoDB table, so this option is incorrect.

<strong>Create an IAM role in Account B with access to DynamoDB. Modify the trust policy of the execution role in Account A to allow the execution role of Lambda to assume the IAM role in Account B. Update the Lambda function code to add the AssumeRole API call</strong> - As mentioned in the explanation above, you need to modify the trust policy of the IAM role in Account B so that it allows the execution role of Lambda function in account A to assume the IAM role in Account B.

<strong>Put the two containers into a single task definition using a Fargate Launch Type</strong>

Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, fast, container management service that makes it easy to run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster. You can host your cluster on a serverless infrastructure that is managed by Amazon ECS by launching your services or tasks using the Fargate launch type. For more control over your infrastructure, you can host your tasks on a cluster of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances that you manage by using the EC2 launch type.

<img src="https://d1.awsstatic.com/diagrams/product-page-diagrams/product-page-diagram_ECS_1.86ebd8c223ec8b55aa1903c423fbe4e672f3daf7.png">

As the development team is looking for a serverless data store service, therefore the two containers should be launched into a single task definition using a Fargate Launch Type. Using a single task definition allows the two containers to share memory. Please see these use-cases for Fargate Launch type when you should put multiple containers into the same task definition:

<strong>Put the two containers into two separate task definitions using an EC2 Launch Type</strong>

<strong>Put the two containers into a single task definition using an EC2 Launch Type</strong>

As the development team is looking for a serverless data store service, therefore EC2 Launch Type is ruled out. So both these options are incorrect.

<strong>Create a cross-stack reference and use the Export output field to flag the value of VPC from the network stack. Then use Fn::ImportValue intrinsic function to import the value of VPC into the web application stack</strong>

AWS CloudFormation gives developers and businesses an easy way to create a collection of related AWS and third-party resources and provision them in an orderly and predictable fashion.

How CloudFormation Works:
<img src="https://d1.awsstatic.com/Products/product-name/diagrams/product-page-diagram_CloudFormation.ad3a4c93b4fdd3366da3da0de4fb084d89a5d761.png">
via - <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/</a>

You can create a cross-stack reference to export resources from one AWS CloudFormation stack to another. For example, you might have a network stack with a VPC and subnets and a separate public web application stack. To use the security group and subnet from the network stack, you can create a cross-stack reference that allows the web application stack to reference resource outputs from the network stack. With a cross-stack reference, owners of the web application stacks don't need to create or maintain networking rules or assets.

To create a cross-stack reference, use the Export output field to flag the value of a resource output for export. Then, use the Fn::ImportValue intrinsic function to import the value.

You cannot use the Ref intrinsic function to import the value.

<strong>Create a cross-stack reference and use the Outputs output field to flag the value of VPC from the network stack. Then use Ref intrinsic function to reference the value of VPC into the web application stack</strong>

<strong>Create a cross-stack reference and use the Export output field to flag the value of VPC from the network stack. Then use Ref intrinsic function to reference the value of VPC into the web application stack</strong>

<strong>Use Cognito Authentication via Cognito User Pools for your Application Load Balancer</strong>

Application Load Balancer can be used to securely authenticate users for accessing your applications. This enables you to offload the work of authenticating users to your load balancer so that your applications can focus on their business logic. You can use Cognito User Pools to authenticate users through well-known social IdPs, such as Amazon, Facebook, or Google, through the user pools supported by Amazon Cognito or through corporate identities, using SAML, LDAP, or Microsoft AD, through the user pools supported by Amazon Cognito. You configure user authentication by creating an authenticate action for one or more listener rules. The authenticate-cognito and authenticate-oidc action types are supported only with HTTPS listeners.

Incorrect options:

<strong>Use Cognito Authentication via Cognito Identity Pools for your Application Load Balancer</strong> - There is no such thing as using Cognito Authentication via Cognito Identity Pools for managing user authentication for the application. Application-specific user authentication can be provided via Cognito User Pools. Amazon Cognito identity pools provide temporary AWS credentials for users who are guests (unauthenticated) and for users who have been authenticated and received a token.

<strong>Use Cognito Authentication via Cognito User Pools for your CloudFront distribution</strong> - You cannot directly integrate Cognito User Pools with CloudFront distribution as you have to create a separate Lambda@Edge function to accomplish the authentication via Cognito User Pools. This involves additional development effort, so this option is not the best fit for the given use-case.

<strong>Use Cognito Authentication via Cognito Identity Pools for your CloudFront distribution</strong> - You cannot use Cognito Identity Pools for managing user authentication, so this option is not correct.

13:Tb4e,Correct option:

<strong>Use ChangeMessageVisibility action to extend a message's visibility timeout</strong>

Amazon SQS uses a visibility timeout to prevent other consumers from receiving and processing the same message. The default visibility timeout for a message is 30 seconds. The minimum is 0 seconds. The maximum is 12 hours.

<img src="https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-dva-pt/assets/pt1-q5-i1.jpg">
via - <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-visibility-timeout.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-visibility-timeout.html</a>

For example, you have a message with a visibility timeout of 5 minutes. After 3 minutes, you call ChangeMessageVisibility with a timeout of 10 minutes. You can continue to call ChangeMessageVisibility to extend the visibility timeout to the maximum allowed time. If you try to extend the visibility timeout beyond the maximum, your request is rejected. So, for the given use-case, the application can set the initial visibility timeout to 1 minute and then continue to update the ChangeMessageVisibility value if required.

<img src="https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-dva-pt/assets/pt1-q5-i2.jpg">

Incorrect options:

<strong>Use DelaySeconds action to delay a message's visibility timeout</strong> - Delay queues let you postpone the delivery of new messages to a queue for a number of seconds. To set delay seconds on individual messages, rather than on an entire queue, use message timers to allow Amazon SQS to use the message timer's DelaySeconds value instead of the delay queue's DelaySeconds value. You cannot use DelaySeconds to alter the visibility of a message which has been picked for processing.

<strong>Use WaitTimeSeconds action to short poll and extend a message's visibility timeout</strong>

<strong>Use WaitTimeSeconds action to long poll and extend a message's visibility timeout</strong>

Amazon SQS provides short polling and long polling to receive messages from a queue. Both these options have been added as distractors as WaitTimeSeconds (via short polling or long polling) cannot be used to influence the message's visibility.

14:Tc25,Correct option:

<strong>Set up reserved concurrency for the Lambda function B so that it throttles if it goes above a certain concurrency limit</strong>

Concurrency is the number of requests that a Lambda function is serving at any given time. If a Lambda function is invoked again while a request is still being processed, another instance is allocated, which increases the function's concurrency.

To ensure that a function can always reach a certain level of concurrency, you can configure the function with reserved concurrency. When a function has reserved concurrency, no other function can use that concurrency. More importantly, reserved concurrency also limits the maximum concurrency for the function, and applies to the function as a whole, including versions and aliases.

Please review this note to understand how reserved concurrency works:

<img src="https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-dva-pt/assets/pt1-q6-i1.jpg">
via - <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-concurrency.html#configuration-concurrency-reserved">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-concurrency.html#configuration-concurrency-reserved</a>

Therefore using reserved concurrency for Lambda function B would limit its maximum concurrency and allow Lambda function A to execute without getting throttled.

Incorrect options:

<strong>Set up provisioned concurrency for the Lambda function B so that it throttles if it goes above a certain concurrency limit</strong> - You should use provisioned concurrency to enable your function to scale without fluctuations in latency. By allocating provisioned concurrency before an increase in invocations, you can ensure that all requests are served by initialized instances with very low latency. Provisioned concurrency is not used to limit the maximum concurrency for a given Lambda function, so this option is incorrect.

<strong>Use an API Gateway instead of an Application Load Balancer (ALB) for Lambda function A</strong> - This has been added as a distractor as using an API Gateway for Lambda function A has no bearing on limiting the concurrency of Lambda function B, so this option is incorrect.

<strong>Use a Cloudfront Distribution instead of an Application Load Balancer (ALB) for Lambda function A</strong> - When you associate a CloudFront distribution with a Lambda function (known as Lambda@Edge), CloudFront intercepts requests and responses at CloudFront edge locations and runs the function. Again, this has no bearing on limiting the concurrency of Lambda function B, so this option is incorrect.

15:Tb27,Correct option:

"Configure an SSL/TLS certificate on an Application Load Balancer via AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)"

"Create an HTTPS listener on the Application Load Balancer with SSL termination"

An Application load balancer distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, in multiple Availability Zones. A listener checks for connection requests from clients, using the protocol and port that you configure. The rules that you define for a listener determine how the load balancer routes requests to its registered targets. Each rule consists of a priority, one or more actions, and one or more conditions.

<img src="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/images/component_architecture.png">
via - <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html</a>

To use an HTTPS listener, you must deploy at least one SSL/TLS server certificate on your load balancer. You can create an HTTPS listener, which uses encrypted connections (also known as SSL offload). This feature enables traffic encryption between your load balancer and the clients that initiate SSL or TLS sessions. As the EC2 instances are under heavy CPU load, the load balancer will use the server certificate to terminate the front-end connection and then decrypt requests from clients before sending them to the EC2 instances.

Please review this resource to understand how to associate an ACM SSL/TLS certificate with an Application Load Balancer:
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/associate-acm-certificate-alb-nlb/">https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/associate-acm-certificate-alb-nlb/</a>

Incorrect options:

"Create an HTTPS listener on the Application Load Balancer with SSL pass-through" - If you use an HTTPS listener with SSL pass-through, then the EC2 instances would continue to be under heavy CPU load as they would still need to decrypt the secure traffic
at the instance level. Hence this option is incorrect.

"Create an HTTP listener on the Application Load Balancer with SSL termination"

"Create an HTTP listener on the Application Load Balancer with SSL pass-through"

You cannot have an HTTP listener for an Application Load Balancer to support SSL termination or SSL pass-through, so both these options are incorrect.

<strong>Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C)</strong>

You have the following options for protecting data at rest in Amazon S3:

Server-Side Encryption – Request Amazon S3 to encrypt your object before saving it on disks in its data centers and then decrypt it when you download the objects.

Client-Side Encryption – Encrypt data client-side and upload the encrypted data to Amazon S3. In this case, you manage the encryption process, the encryption keys, and related tools.

For the given use-case, the company wants to manage the encryption keys via its custom application and let S3 manage the encryption, therefore you must use Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C).

Please review these three options for Server Side Encryption on S3:

via - <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html</a>

Incorrect options:

<strong>Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3)</strong> - When you use Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3), each object is encrypted with a unique key. As an additional safeguard, it encrypts the key itself with a master key that it regularly rotates. So this option is incorrect.

<strong>Server-Side Encryption with Customer Master Keys (CMKs) Stored in AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS)</strong> - Server-Side Encryption with Customer Master Keys (CMKs) stored in AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS) is similar to SSE-S3. SSE-KMS provides you with an audit trail that shows when your CMK was used and by whom. Additionally, you can create and manage customer-managed CMKs or use AWS managed CMKs that are unique to you, your service, and your Region.

<strong>Client-Side Encryption with data encryption is done on the client-side before sending it to Amazon S3</strong> - You can encrypt the data client-side and upload the encrypted data to Amazon S3. In this case, you manage the encryption process, the encryption keys, and related tools.

<strong>AWS Kinesis Data Streams</strong>

Amazon Kinesis Data Streams (KDS) is a massively scalable and durable real-time data streaming service. KDS can continuously capture gigabytes of data per second from hundreds of thousands of sources such as website clickstreams, database event streams, financial transactions, social media feeds, IT logs, and location-tracking events. The data collected is available in milliseconds to enable real-time analytics use cases such as real-time dashboards, real-time anomaly detection, dynamic pricing, and more.

Amazon Kinesis Data Streams enables real-time processing of streaming big data. It provides ordering of records, as well as the ability to read and/or replay records in the same order to multiple Amazon Kinesis Applications. The Amazon Kinesis Client Library (KCL) delivers all records for a given partition key to the same record processor, making it easier to build multiple applications reading from the same Amazon Kinesis data stream (for example, to perform counting, aggregation, and filtering).
Amazon Kinesis Data Streams is recommended when you need the ability for multiple applications to consume the same stream concurrently. For example, you have one application that updates a real-time dashboard and another application that archives data to Amazon Redshift. You want both applications to consume data from the same stream concurrently and independently.

Incorrect options:

<strong>AWS Kinesis Data Firehose</strong> - Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is the easiest way to load streaming data into data stores and analytics tools. It can capture, transform, and load streaming data into Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, Amazon Elasticsearch Service, and Splunk, enabling near real-time analytics with existing business intelligence tools and dashboards you’re already using today. It is a fully managed service that automatically scales to match the throughput of your data and requires no ongoing administration. It can also batch, compress, and encrypt the data before loading it, minimizing the amount of storage used at the destination and increasing security. As Kinesis Data Firehose is used to load streaming data into data stores, therefore this option is incorrect.

<strong>AWS Kinesis Data Analytics</strong> - Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics is the easiest way to analyze streaming data in real-time.  You can quickly build SQL queries and sophisticated Java applications using built-in templates and operators for common processing functions to organize, transform, aggregate, and analyze data at any scale. Kinesis Data Analytics enables you to easily and quickly build queries and sophisticated streaming applications in three simple steps: setup your streaming data sources, write your queries or streaming applications and set up your destination for processed data. As Kinesis Data Analytics is used to build SQL queries and sophisticated Java applications, therefore this option is incorrect.

<strong>Amazon SQS</strong> - Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. SQS offers two types of message queues. Standard queues offer maximum throughput, best-effort ordering, and at-least-once delivery. SQS FIFO queues are designed to guarantee that messages are processed exactly once, in the exact order that they are sent. For SQS, you cannot have the same message being consumed by multiple consumers at the same time, therefore this option is incorrect.

Exam alert:

Please remember that Kinesis Data Firehose is used to load streaming data into data stores (Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, Amazon Elasticsearch Service, and Splunk) whereas Kinesis Data Streams provides support for real-time processing of streaming data. It provides ordering of records, as well as the ability to read and/or replay records in the same order to multiple downstream Amazon Kinesis Applications.

<strong>Deploy the new version to a separate environment via Blue/Green Deployment, and then swap Route 53 records of the two environments to redirect traffic to the new version</strong>

With deployment policies such as 'All at once', AWS Elastic Beanstalk performs an in-place update when you update your application versions and your application can become unavailable to users for a short period of time. You can avoid this downtime by performing a blue/green deployment, where you deploy the new version to a separate environment, and then swap CNAMEs (via Route 53) of the two environments to redirect traffic to the new version instantly. In case of any deployment issues, the rollback process is very quick via swapping the URLs for the two environments.

Incorrect options:

<strong>Deploy the new application version using 'All at once' deployment policy</strong> - Although 'All at once' is the quickest deployment method, but the application may become unavailable to users (or have low availability) for a short time. So this option is not correct.

<strong>Deploy the new application version using 'Rolling' deployment policy</strong> - This policy avoids downtime and minimizes reduced availability, at a cost of a longer deployment time. However rollback process is via manual redeploy, so it's not as quick as the Blue/Green deployment.

<strong>Deploy the new application version using 'Rolling with additional batch' deployment policy</strong> - This policy avoids any reduced availability, at a cost of an even longer deployment time compared to the Rolling method. Suitable if you must maintain the same bandwidth throughout the deployment. However rollback process is via manual redeploy, so it's not as quick as the Blue/Green deployment.

19:T7d3,Correct option:

DynamoDB stores data as groups of attributes, known as items. Items are similar to rows or records in other database systems. DynamoDB stores and retrieves each item based on the primary key value, which must be unique. Items are distributed across 10-GB storage units, called partitions (physical storage internal to DynamoDB).

DynamoDB uses the partition key’s value as an input to an internal hash function. The output from the hash function determines the partition in which the item is stored. Each item’s location is determined by the hash value of its partition key.

Please see these details for the DynamoDB Partition Keys:

<strong>movie_id</strong>

The movie_id attribute has high-cardinality across the entire collection of the movie database, hence it is the most suitable candidate for the partition key in this use case.

Incorrect options:

<strong>producer_name</strong>  - Does not qualify because the attribute will have duplicate values (and therefore low cardinality)

<strong>lead_actor_name</strong> - Does not qualify because the attribute will have duplicate values (and therefore low cardinality)

<strong>movie_language</strong> - Does not qualify because the attribute will have duplicate values (and therefore low cardinality)

1a:T6a0,Correct option:

AWS CloudFormation provides several built-in functions that help you manage your stacks. Intrinsic functions are used in templates to assign values to properties that are not available until runtime.

<strong>!GetAtt</strong> - The Fn::GetAtt intrinsic function returns the value of an attribute from a resource in the template. This example snippet returns a string containing the DNS name of the load balancer with the logical name myELB -
YML :   !GetAtt myELB.DNSName
JSON :   "Fn::GetAtt" : [ "myELB" , "DNSName" ]

Incorrect options:

<strong>!Sub</strong> - The intrinsic function Fn::Sub substitutes variables in an input string with values that you specify. In your templates, you can use this function to construct commands or outputs that include values that aren't available until you create or update a stack.

<strong>!Ref</strong> - The intrinsic function Ref returns the value of the specified parameter or resource.

<strong>!FindInMap</strong> - The intrinsic function Fn::FindInMap returns the value corresponding to keys in a two-level map that is declared in the Mappings section. For example, you can use this in the Mappings section that contains a single map, RegionMap, that associates AMIs with AWS regions.

1b:Tad3,Correct options:

<strong>Stage Variables</strong>

Stage variables are name-value pairs that you can define as configuration attributes associated with a deployment stage of an API. They act like environment variables and can be used in your API setup and mapping templates. With deployment stages in API Gateway, you can manage multiple release stages for each API, such as alpha, beta, and production. Using stage variables you can configure an API deployment stage to interact with different backend endpoints.

For example, your API can pass a GET request as an HTTP proxy to the backend web host (for example, http://example.com). In this case, the backend web host is configured in a stage variable so that when developers call your production endpoint, API Gateway calls example.com. When you call your beta endpoint, API Gateway uses the value configured in the stage variable for the beta stage and calls a different web host (for example, beta.example.com).

<strong>Lambda Aliases</strong>

A Lambda alias is like a pointer to a specific Lambda function version. Users can access the function version using the alias ARN.

Lambda Aliases allow you to create a "mutable" Lambda version that points to whatever version you want in the backend. This allows you to have a "dev", "test", prod" Lambda alias that can remain stable over time.

Incorrect options:

<strong>Lambda Versions</strong> - Versions are immutable and cannot be updated over time. So this option is not correct.

<strong>Lambda X-Ray integration</strong> - This is good for tracing and debugging requests so it can be looked at as a good option for troubleshooting issues in the future. This is not the right fit for the given use-case.

<strong>Mapping Templates</strong> - Mapping template overrides provides you with the flexibility to perform many-to-one parameter mappings; override parameters after standard API Gateway mappings have been applied; conditionally map parameters based on body content or other parameter values; programmatically create new parameters on the fly, and override status codes returned by your integration endpoint. This is not the right fit for the given use-case.

<strong>Increase the RAM assigned to your Lambda function</strong>

AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time you consume.

In the AWS Lambda resource model, you choose the amount of memory you want for your function which allocates proportional CPU power and other resources. This means you will have access to more compute power when you choose one of the new larger settings. You can set your memory in 64MB increments from 128MB to 3008MB. You access these settings when you create a function or update its configuration. The settings are available using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or SDKs.

via - <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-console.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-console.html</a>

Therefore, by increasing the amount of memory available to the Lambda functions, you can run the compute-heavy workflows.

Incorrect options:

<strong>Change the instance type for your Lambda function</strong> - Instance types apply to the EC2 service and not to Lambda function as its a serverless service.

<strong>Change your Lambda function runtime to use Golang</strong> - This changes programming language which requires code changes, so this option is not correct. Besides, changing the runtime may not even address the performance issues.

<strong>Increase the Lambda function timeout</strong> - This option would increase the amount of time for which the Lambda function executes, which may help in case you have some heavy processing, but won't help with the actual performance of your Lambda function.

1d:T650,Correct option:

HTTP requests and HTTP responses use header fields to send information about the HTTP messages. Header fields are colon-separated name-value pairs that are separated by a carriage return (CR) and a line feed (LF).

<strong>X-Forwarded-For</strong> - The X-Forwarded-For request header helps you identify the IP address of a client when you use an HTTP or HTTPS load balancer. Because load balancers intercept traffic between clients and servers, your server access logs contain only the IP address of the load balancer. To see the IP address of the client, use the X-Forwarded-For request header.

Incorrect options:

<strong>X-Forwarded-Proto</strong> - The X-Forwarded-Proto request header helps you identify the protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) that a client used to connect to your load balancer. Your server access logs contain only the protocol used between the server and the load balancer; they contain no information about the protocol used between the client and the load balancer. To determine the protocol used between the client and the load balancer, use the X-Forwarded-Proto request header.

<strong>X-Forwarded-Port</strong> - The X-Forwarded-Port request header helps you identify the destination port that the client used to connect to the load balancer.

<strong>X-Forwarded-IP</strong> - This is a made-up option and has been added as a distractor.

1e:T8f1,Correct options:

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling is a fully managed service designed to launch or terminate Amazon EC2 instances automatically to help ensure you have the correct number of Amazon EC2 instances available to handle the load for your application.

<strong>Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling cannot add a volume to an existing instance if the existing volume is approaching capacity</strong> - A volume is attached to a new instance when it is added. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling doesn't automatically add a volume when the existing one is approaching capacity. You can use the EC2 API to add a volume to an existing instance.

<strong>Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling works with both Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers</strong> - Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling works with Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers including their health check feature.

Incorrect options:

<strong>EC2 Auto Scaling groups are regional constructs. They span across Availability Zones and AWS regions</strong> - This is an incorrect statement. EC2 Auto Scaling groups are regional constructs. They can span Availability Zones, but not AWS regions.

<strong>Every time you create an Auto Scaling group from an existing instance, it creates a new AMI (Amazon Machine Image)</strong> - This is an incorrect statement. When you create an Auto Scaling group from an existing instance, it does not create a new AMI.

<strong>You cannot use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling for health checks (to replace unhealthy instances) if you are not using Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)</strong> - This is an incorrect statement. You don't have to use ELB to use Auto Scaling. You can use the EC2 health check to identify and replace unhealthy instances.

<strong>ALB + ECS</strong>

Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) is a highly scalable, high-performance container management service that supports Docker containers and allows you to easily run applications on a managed cluster of Amazon EC2 instances.

How ECS Works:
<img src="https://d1.awsstatic.com/diagrams/product-page-diagrams/product-page-diagram_ECS_1.86ebd8c223ec8b55aa1903c423fbe4e672f3daf7.png">
via - <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/">https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/</a>

Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, and Lambda functions. It can handle the varying load of your application traffic in a single Availability Zone or across multiple Availability Zones.

When you use ECS with a load balancer such as ALB deployed across multiple Availability Zones, it helps provide a scalable and highly available REST API.

<strong>API Gateway + Lambda</strong>

Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. Using API Gateway, you can create an API that acts as a “front door” for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your back-end services, such as EC2 or Lambda functions.

How API Gateway Works:

API Gateway and Lambda help achieve the same purpose integrating some capabilities such as authentication in a serverless fashion, with fully scalable and highly available architectures.

Incorrect options:

<strong>SES + S3</strong> - The combination of these services only provide email and object storage services.

<strong>CloudWatch + CloudFront</strong> - The combination of these services only provide monitoring and fast content delivery network (CDN) services.

<strong>EBS + RDS</strong> - The combination of these services only provide elastic block storage and database services.

<strong>Specify a ProjectionExpression</strong>: A projection expression is a string that identifies the attributes you want. To retrieve a single attribute, specify its name. For multiple attributes, the names must be comma-separated.

Incorrect options:

<strong>Use a FilterExpression</strong> - If you need to further refine the Query results, you can optionally provide a filter expression. A filter expression determines which items within the Query results should be returned to you. All of the other results are discarded. A filter expression is applied after Query finishes, but before the results are returned. Therefore, a Query consumes the same amount of read capacity, regardless of whether a filter expression is present. A Query operation can retrieve a maximum of 1 MB of data. This limit applies before the filter expression is evaluated.

<strong>Use the --query parameter</strong> - The Query operation in Amazon DynamoDB finds items based on primary key values. You must provide the name of the partition key attribute and a single value for that attribute. The Query returns all items with that partition key value. Optionally, you can provide a sort key attribute and use a comparison operator to refine the search results.

<strong>Use a Scan</strong> - A Scan operation in Amazon DynamoDB reads every item in a table or a secondary index. By default, a Scan operation returns all of the data attributes for every item in the table or index. You can also use the ProjectionExpression parameter so that Scan only returns some of the attributes, rather than all of them.

21:T445,Correct option:

<strong>4 KB</strong>

You can encrypt up to 4 kilobytes (4096 bytes) of arbitrary data such as an RSA key, a database password, or other sensitive information.

While AWS KMS does support sending data up to 4 KB to be encrypted directly, envelope encryption can offer significant performance benefits. When you encrypt data directly with AWS KMS it must be transferred over the network. Envelope encryption reduces the network load since only the request and delivery of the much smaller data key go over the network. The data key is used locally in your application or encrypting AWS service, avoiding the need to send the entire block of data to AWS KMS and suffer network latency.

Incorrect options:

<strong>1MB</strong> - For anything over 4 KB, you may want to look at envelope encryption

<strong>10MB</strong> - For anything over 4 KB, you may want to look at envelope encryption

<strong>16KB</strong> - For anything over 4 KB, you may want to look at envelope encryption

<strong>Change the queue message retention setting</strong> - Amazon SQS automatically deletes messages that have been in a queue for more than the maximum message retention period. The default message retention period is 4 days. However, you can set the message retention period to a value from 60 seconds to 1,209,600 seconds (14 days) using the SetQueueAttributes action.

Incorrect options:

<strong>Enable Long Polling for the SQS queue</strong> - Amazon SQS provides short polling and long polling to receive messages from a queue. By default, queues use short polling. When the wait time for the ReceiveMessage API action is greater than 0, long polling is in effect. The maximum long polling wait time is 20 seconds. Long polling helps reduce the cost of using Amazon SQS by eliminating the number of empty responses (when there are no messages available for a ReceiveMessage request) and false empty responses (when messages are available but aren't included in a response). This feature is not useful for the current use case.

<strong>The maximum retention period of SQS messages is 7 days, therefore retention period of 12 days is not possible</strong> - This is an incorrect statement. Retention period of up to 14 days is possible.

<strong>Use a FIFO SQS queue</strong> - FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queues are designed to enhance messaging between applications when the order of operations and events is critical, or where duplicates can't be tolerated. This is not useful for the current scenario.

<strong>Use X-Ray service</strong> - AWS X-Ray helps developers analyze and debug production, distributed applications, such as those built using a microservices architecture. With X-Ray, you can understand how your application and its underlying services are performing to identify and troubleshoot the root cause of performance issues and errors. X-Ray provides an end-to-end view of requests as they travel through your application, and shows a map of your application’s underlying components. You can use X-Ray to analyze both applications in development and in production, from simple three-tier applications to complex microservices applications consisting of thousands of services.

AWS X-Ray creates a map of services used by your application with trace data that you can use to drill into specific services or issues. This provides a view of connections between services in your application and aggregated data for each service, including average latency and failure rates. You can create dependency trees, perform cross-availability zone or region call detections, and more.

Incorrect options:

<strong>Use CloudTrail service</strong> - With CloudTrail, you can get a history of AWS API calls for your account - including API calls made via the AWS Management Console, AWS SDKs, command-line tools, and higher-level AWS services (such as AWS CloudFormation). This is a very useful service for general monitoring and tracking. But, it will not give a detailed analysis of the outcome of microservices or drill into specific issues. For the current use case, X-Ray offers a better solution.

<strong>Use API Gateway service</strong> - Amazon API Gateway is an AWS service for creating, publishing, maintaining, monitoring, and securing REST, HTTP, and WebSocket APIs at any scale. API Gateway will not be able to drill into the flow between different microservices or their issues.

<strong>Use CloudWatch service</strong> - Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and management service that provides data and actionable insights for AWS, hybrid, and on-premises applications and infrastructure resources. CloudWatch can collect numbers and respond to AWS service-related events, but it can't help you debug microservices specific issues on AWS.

Incorrect options:

<strong>You can encrypt an existing unencrypted volume or snapshot by using AWS Key Management Service (KMS) AWS SDKs</strong> - This is an incorrect statement. There is no direct way to encrypt an existing unencrypted volume or snapshot. You can encrypt an unencrypted snapshot by copying and enabling encryption while copying the snapshot. To encrypt an EBS volume, you need to create a snapshot and then encrypt the snapshot as described earlier. From this new encrypted snapshot, you can then create an encrypted volume.

<strong>A snapshot of an encrypted volume can be encrypted or unencrypted</strong> - This is an incorrect statement. You cannot remove encryption from an encrypted volume or snapshot, which means that a volume restored from an encrypted snapshot, or a copy of an encrypted snapshot is always encrypted.

<strong>Encryption by default is an AZ specific setting. If you enable it for an AZ, you cannot disable it for individual volumes or snapshots in that AZ</strong> - This is an incorrect statement. Encryption by default is a Region-specific setting. If you enable it for a Region, you cannot disable it for individual volumes or snapshots in that Region.

<strong>AWS CloudTrail event logs for 'ManageVolume' aren't available for EBS volumes created during an Amazon EC2 launch</strong> - Event 'ManageVolume' is a made-up option and has been added as a distractor.

<strong>Amazon EBS CloudWatch metrics are disabled</strong> - Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) sends data points to CloudWatch for several metrics. Data is only reported to CloudWatch when the volume is attached to an instance. CloudWatch metrics are useful in tracking the status or life cycle changes of an EBS volume, they are not useful in knowing about the metadata of EBS volumes.

<strong>EBS volume status checks are disabled</strong> - Volume status checks enable you to better understand, track and manage potential inconsistencies in the data on an Amazon EBS volume. They are designed to provide you with the information that you need to determine whether your Amazon EBS volumes are impaired, and to help you control how a potentially inconsistent volume is handled. Our current use case requires us to pull data about EBS volume metadata, which is not possible with this feature.

AWS CloudTrail is a service that enables governance, compliance, operational auditing, and risk auditing of your AWS account. With CloudTrail, you can log, continuously monitor, and retain account activity related to actions across your AWS infrastructure. CloudTrail provides an event history of your AWS account activity, including actions taken through the AWS Management Console, AWS SDKs, command-line tools, and other AWS services.

AWS CloudTrail increases visibility into your user and resource activity by recording AWS Management Console actions and API calls. You can identify which users and accounts called AWS, the source IP address from which the calls were made, and when the calls occurred.

Incorrect options:

<strong>Amazon CloudWatch</strong> - Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and management service that provides data and actionable insights for AWS, hybrid, and on-premises applications and infrastructure resources. CloudWatch can collect numbers and respond to AWS service-related events, but it does not help in user activity logging.

<strong>AWS X-Ray</strong> - AWS X-Ray helps developers analyze and debug production, distributed applications, such as those built using a microservices architecture. With X-Ray, you can understand how your application and its underlying services are performing to identify and troubleshoot the root cause of performance issues and errors. X-Ray is a very important tool in troubleshooting but is not useful in logging user activity.

<strong>Amazon Inspector</strong> - Amazon Inspector is an automated security assessment service that helps improve the security and compliance of applications deployed on AWS. Amazon Inspector security assessments help you check for unintended network accessibility of your Amazon EC2 instances and for vulnerabilities on those EC2 instances. This does not log User activity at the account level.

<strong>Create an LSI</strong>

LSI stands for Local Secondary Index. Some applications only need to query data using the base table's primary key; however, there may be situations where an alternate sort key would be helpful. To give your application a choice of sort keys, you can create one or more local secondary indexes on a table and issue Query or Scan requests against these indexes.

Differences between GSI and LSI:

Incorrect options:

<strong>Call Scan</strong> - Scan is an operation on the data. Once you create your local secondary indexes on a table you can then issue a Scan requests again.

<strong>Create a GSI</strong> - GSI (Global Secondary Index) is an index with a partition key and a sort key that can be different from those on the base table.

<strong>Migrate away from DynamoDB</strong> - Migrating to another database that is not NoSQL may cause you to make changes that require substantial code changes.

28:Ta25,Correct option:

Amazon DynamoDB is a key-value and document database that delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale. It's a fully managed, multi-Region, multi-master, durable database with built-in security, backup, and restore and in-memory caching for internet-scale applications.

<strong>Consider using Global tables if your application is accessed by globally distributed users</strong> - If you have globally dispersed users, consider using global tables. With global tables, you can specify the AWS Regions where you want the table to be available. This can significantly reduce latency for your users. So, reducing the distance between the client and the DynamoDB endpoint is an important performance fix to be considered.

<strong>Use eventually consistent reads in place of strongly consistent reads whenever possible</strong> - If your application doesn't require strongly consistent reads, consider using eventually consistent reads. Eventually consistent reads are cheaper and are less likely to experience high latency.

Incorrect options:

<strong>Increase the request timeout settings, so the client gets enough time to complete the requests, thereby reducing retries on the system</strong> - This statement is incorrect. The right way is to reduce the request timeout settings. This causes the client to abandon high latency requests after the specified time period and then send a second request that usually completes much faster than the first.

<strong>Reduce connection pooling, which keeps the connections alive even when user requests are not present, thereby, blocking the services</strong> - This is not correct. When you're not making requests, consider having the client send dummy traffic to a DynamoDB table. Alternatively, you can reuse client connections or use connection pooling. All of these techniques keep internal caches warm, which helps keep latency low.

<strong>Use DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) for businesses with heavy write-only workloads</strong> - This is not correct. If your traffic is read-heavy, consider using a caching service such as DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX). DAX is a fully managed, highly available, in-memory cache for DynamoDB that delivers up to a 10x performance improvement—from milliseconds to microseconds—even at millions of requests per second.

29:Ta3b,Correct option:

<strong>Create a saved configuration in Team A's account and download it to your local machine. Make the account-specific parameter changes and upload to the S3 bucket in Team B's account. From Elastic Beanstalk console, create an application from 'Saved Configurations</strong> - You must use saved configurations to migrate an Elastic Beanstalk environment between AWS accounts.
You can save your environment's configuration as an object in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) that can be applied to other environments during environment creation, or applied to a running environment. Saved configurations are YAML formatted templates that define an environment's platform version, tier, configuration option settings, and tags.

Download the saved configuration to your local machine. Change your account-specific parameters in the downloaded configuration file, and then save the changes. For example, change the key pair name, subnet ID, or application name (such as application-b-name). Upload the saved configuration from your local machine to an S3 bucket in Team B's account. From this account, create a new Beanstalk application by choosing 'Saved Configurations' from the navigation panel.

Incorrect options:

<strong>Create a saved configuration in Team A's account and configure it to Export. Now, log into Team B's account and choose the Import option. Here, you need to specify the name of the saved configuration and allow the system to create the new application. This takes a little time based on the Regions the two accounts belong to</strong> - There is no direct Export and Import
option for migrating Elastic Beanstalk configurations.

<strong>It is not possible to migrate Elastic Beanstalk environment from one AWS account to the other</strong> - This is an incorrect statement.

<strong>Create an export configuration from the Elastic Beanstalk console from Team A's account. This configuration has to be shared with the IAM Role of Team B's account. The import option of the Team B's account will show the saved configuration, that can be used to create a new Beanstalk application</strong> - This contradicts the explanation provided earlier.

2a:T79a,Correct option:

<strong>If two writes are made to a single non-versioned object at the same time, it is possible that only a single event notification will be sent</strong> - Amazon S3 event notifications are designed to be delivered at least once. Typically, event notifications are delivered in seconds but can sometimes take a minute or longer.

If two writes are made to a single non-versioned object at the same time, it is possible that only a single event notification will be sent. If you want to ensure that an event notification is sent for every successful write, you can enable versioning on your bucket. With versioning, every successful write will create a new version of your object and will also send event notification.

Incorrect options:

<strong>Someone could have created a new notification configuration and that has overridden your existing configuration</strong> - It is possible that the configuration can be overridden. But, in the current scenario, the team lead is receiving notifications for most of the events, which nullifies the claim that the configuration is overridden.

<strong>Versioning is enabled on the S3 bucket and event notifications are getting fired for only one version</strong> - This is an incorrect statement. If you want to ensure that an event notification is sent for every successful write, you should enable versioning on your bucket. With versioning, every successful write will create a new version of your object and will also send event notification.

<strong>Your notification action is writing to the same bucket that triggers the notification</strong> - If your notification ends up writing to the bucket that triggers the notification, this could cause an execution loop. But it will not result in missing events.

2b:T812,Correct option:

<strong>The health check type of your instance's Auto Scaling group, must be changed from EC2 to ELB by using a configuration file</strong> - By default, the health check configuration of your Auto Scaling group is set as an EC2 type that performs a status check of EC2 instances. To automate the replacement of unhealthy EC2 instances, you must change the health check type of your instance's Auto Scaling group from EC2 to ELB by using a configuration file.

Incorrect options:

<strong>Health check parameters were configured for checking the instance health alone. The instance failed because of application failure which was not configured as a parameter for health check status</strong> - This is an incorrect statement. Status checks, by definition, cover only an EC2 instance's health, and not the health of your application, server, or any Docker containers running on the instance.

<strong>Auto Scaling group doesn't automatically replace the unhealthy instances marked by the load balancer. They have to be manually replaced from AWS Console</strong> - Incorrect statement. As discussed above, if the health check type of ASG is changed from EC2 to ELB, Auto Scaling will be able to replace the unhealthy instance.

<strong>The ping path field of the Load Balancer is configured incorrectly</strong> - Ping path is a health check configuration field of Elastic Load Balancer. If the ping path is configured wrong, ELB will not be able to reach the instance and hence will consider the instance unhealthy. However, this would then apply to all instances, not just once instance. So it does not address the issue given in the use-case.

2c:Tb7a,Correct option:

<strong>Use a dead-letter queue to handle message processing failures</strong>

Dead-letter queues can be used by other queues (source queues) as a target for messages that can't be processed (consumed) successfully. Dead-letter queues are useful for debugging your application or messaging system because they let you isolate problematic messages to determine why their processing doesn't succeed.

Sometimes, messages can’t be processed because of a variety of possible issues, such as when a user comments on a story but it remains unprocessed because the original story itself is deleted by the author while the comments were being posted. In such a case, the dead-letter queue can be used to handle message processing failures.

How do dead-letter queues work?

Incorrect options:

<strong>Use a temporary queue to handle message processing failures</strong> - The most common use case for temporary queues is the request-response messaging pattern (for example, processing a login request), where a requester creates a temporary queue for receiving each response message. To avoid creating an Amazon SQS queue for each response message, the Temporary Queue Client lets you create and delete multiple temporary queues without making any Amazon SQS API calls. Temporary queues cannot be used to handle message processing failures.

<strong>Use short polling to handle message processing failures</strong>

<strong>Use long polling to handle message processing failures</strong>

Amazon SQS provides short polling and long polling to receive messages from a queue. By default, queues use short polling. With short polling, Amazon SQS sends the response right away, even if the query found no messages. With long polling, Amazon SQS sends a response after it collects at least one available message, up to the maximum number of messages specified in the request. Amazon SQS sends an empty response only if the polling wait time expires.
Neither short polling nor long polling can be used to handle message processing failures.

2d:Tca9,Correct option:

<strong>Use Enhanced Fanout feature of Kinesis Data Streams</strong>

Amazon Kinesis Data Streams (KDS) is a massively scalable and durable real-time data streaming service. KDS can continuously capture gigabytes of data per second from hundreds of thousands of sources such as website clickstreams, database event streams, financial transactions, social media feeds, IT logs, and location-tracking events.

By default, the 2MB/second/shard output is shared between all of the applications consuming data from the stream. You should use enhanced fan-out if you have multiple consumers retrieving data from a stream in parallel. With enhanced fan-out developers can register stream consumers to use enhanced fan-out and receive their own 2MB/second pipe of read throughput per shard, and this throughput automatically scales with the number of shards in a stream.

Incorrect options:

<strong>Swap out Kinesis Data Streams with Kinesis Data Firehose</strong> -  Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is the easiest way to reliably load streaming data into data lakes, data stores, and analytics tools. It is a fully managed service that automatically scales to match the throughput of your data and requires no ongoing administration. It can also batch, compress, transform, and encrypt the data before loading it, minimizing the amount of storage used at the destination and increasing security. Kinesis Data Firehose can only write to S3, Redshift, Elasticsearch or Splunk. You can't have applications consuming data streams from Kinesis Data Firehose, that's the job of Kinesis Data Streams. Therefore this option is not correct.

<strong>Swap out Kinesis Data Streams with SQS Standard queues</strong>

<strong>Swap out Kinesis Data Streams with SQS FIFO queues</strong>

Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. SQS offers two types of message queues. Standard queues offer maximum throughput, best-effort ordering, and at-least-once delivery. SQS FIFO queues are designed to guarantee that messages are processed exactly once, in the exact order that they are sent. As multiple applications are consuming the same stream concurrently, both SQS Standard and SQS FIFO are not the right fit for the given use-case.

Exam Alert:

Please understand the differences between the capabilities of Kinesis Data Streams vs SQS, as you may be asked scenario-based questions on this topic in the exam.

<strong>AWS Step Functions</strong>

AWS Step Functions is a web service that enables you to coordinate the components of distributed applications and microservices using visual workflows. You build applications from individual components that each perform a discrete function, or task, allowing you to scale and change applications quickly.

Using Step Functions, you can design and run workflows that stitch together services such as AWS Lambda and Amazon ECS into feature-rich applications. Workflows are made up of a series of steps, with the output of one step acting as input into the next.

How Step Functions Work:

via - <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/">https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/</a>

Incorrect options:

<strong>CloudWatch Rules</strong> - CloudWatch rules can integrate with an AWS Lambda function on a schedule. You can send the matching events to an AWS Step Functions state machine to start a workflow responding to the event of interest but CloudWatch rules alone do not create a state machine.

<strong>Amazon Simple Workflow Service</strong> - Amazon Simple Workflow Service is similar to AWS Step functions. With Amazon Simple Workflow Service you can write a program that separates activity steps, allows for more control but increases the complexity of the application. With Amazon Simple Workflow Service you create decider programs and with Step Functions, you define state machines.

<strong>AWS ECS</strong> - The underlying work in your state machine is done by tasks. A task performs work by using an activity, a Lambda function, or by sending parameters to the API actions of other services. You can use AWS ECS to host an activity.

2f:T66c,Correct option:

<strong>System will keep running as is</strong>

You are already running at max capacity. After you have created your Auto Scaling group, the Auto Scaling group starts by launching enough EC2 instances to meet its minimum capacity (or its desired capacity, if specified). If there are no other scaling conditions attached to the Auto Scaling group, the Auto Scaling group maintains this number of running instances even if an instance becomes unhealthy.

Incorrect options:

<strong>The desired capacity will go up to 4 and the maximum capacity will stay at 3</strong> - The desired capacity cannot go over the maximum capacity.

<strong>The desired capacity will go up to 4 and the maximum capacity will also go up to 4</strong> - The maximum capacity cannot change on its own just because the desired capacity has been set to a higher value. You will have to make those changes to the maximum capacity manually.

<strong>System will trigger CloudWatch alarms to AWS support</strong> - This option has been added as a distractor. You already have alarms configured based on rules but AWS support will not intervene for you.

"Using pre-signed URL"

All objects by default are private, with object owner having permission to access the objects. However, the object owner can optionally share objects with others by creating a pre-signed URL, using their own security credentials, to grant time-limited permission to download the objects. When you create a pre-signed URL for your object, you must provide your security credentials, specify a bucket name, an object key, specify the HTTP method (GET to download the object) and expiration date and time. The pre-signed URLs are valid only for the specified duration.

"Using bucket policy" - You can use this policy to limit users from a source IP address however for time-based constraints you are better off using a pre-signed URL.

"Using Routing Policy" - This concept applies to DNS in Route 53, so this option is ruled out.

"Using IAM policy" - You can use IAM policy to grant access toa specific bucket however for time-based constraints you are better off using a pre-signed URL.

<strong>Define a buildspec.yml file in the root directory</strong>

AWS CodeDeploy is a fully managed deployment service that automates software deployments to a variety of compute services such as Amazon EC2, AWS Fargate, AWS Lambda, and your on-premises servers. AWS CodeDeploy makes it easier for you to rapidly release new features, helps you avoid downtime during application deployment, and handles the complexity of updating your applications.

A build spec is a collection of build commands and related settings, in YAML format, that AWS CodeBuild uses to run a build. You can include a build spec as part of the source code or you can define a build spec when you create a build project.

<strong>10</strong>

One Read Capacity Unit represents one strongly consistent read per second, or two eventually consistent reads per second, for an item up to 4 KB in size. If you need to read an item that is larger than 4 KB, DynamoDB will need to consume additional read capacity units. The total number of Read Capacity Units required depends on the item size, and whether you want an eventually consistent or strongly consistent read.

1) Item Size / 4KB, rounding to the nearest whole number.

So, in the above case, 4KB / 4 KB = 1 read capacity unit.

2) 1 read capacity unit per item (since strongly consistent read) × No of reads per second

So, in the above case, 1 x 10 = 10 read capacity units.

<strong>Enable Health Checks</strong>

To discover the availability of your EC2 instances, a load balancer periodically sends pings, attempts connections, or sends requests to test the EC2 instances. These tests are called health checks. The status of the instances that are healthy at the time of the health check is InService. The status of any instances that are unhealthy at the time of the health check is OutOfService.

Incorrect options:

<strong>Enable Stickiness</strong> - Stickiness enables the load balancer to bind a user's session to a specific instance, it cannot be used for gauging the health of an instance.

<strong>Enable Multi-AZ deployments</strong> - It's a good practice to provision instances in more than one availability zone however you still need a way to check the health status of the instances, so this option is incorrect.

<strong>Enable SSL</strong> - This option has been added as a distractor. SSL encrypts the transmission of data between a web server and a browser.

<strong>$(aws ecr get-login --no-include-email)</strong>

<strong>docker pull 1234567890.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/demo:latest</strong>

The get-login command retrieves a token that is valid for a specified registry for 12 hours, and then it prints a docker login command with that authorization token. You can execute the printed command to log in to your registry with Docker, or just run it automatically using the $() command wrapper. After you have logged in to an Amazon ECR registry with this command, you can use the Docker CLI to push and pull images from that registry until the token expires. The docker pull command is used to pull an image from the ECR registry.

Incorrect options:

<strong>docker login -u $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID -p $AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY</strong> - You cannot login to AWS ECR this way. AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY are only used by the CLI and not by docker.

<strong>aws docker push 1234567890.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/demo:latest</strong> - docker push here is the wrong answer, you need to use docker pull.

<strong>CloudFront routes all incoming requests to the primary origin, even when a previous request failed over to the secondary origin</strong>

CloudFront routes all incoming requests to the primary origin, even when a previous request failed over to the secondary origin. CloudFront only sends requests to the secondary origin after a request to the primary origin fails.

<strong>CloudFront fails over to the secondary origin only when the HTTP method of the viewer request is GET, POST or HEAD</strong>

CloudFront fails over to the secondary origin only when the HTTP method of the viewer request is GET, HEAD, or OPTIONS. CloudFront does not failover when the viewer sends a different HTTP method (for example POST, PUT, and so on).

<strong>In the Origin Group of your distribution, all the origins are defined as primary for automatic failover in case an origin fails</strong> - To set up origin failover, you must have a distribution with at least two origins. Next, you create an origin group for your distribution that includes two origins, setting one as the primary. Only one origin can be set as primary.

Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is the easiest way to reliably load streaming data into data lakes, data stores, and analytics services. It can capture, transform, and deliver streaming data to Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, Amazon Elasticsearch Service, generic HTTP endpoints, and service providers like Datadog, New Relic, MongoDB, and Splunk. It is a fully managed service that automatically scales to match the throughput of your data and requires no ongoing administration. It can also batch, compress, transform, and encrypt your data streams before loading, minimizing the amount of storage used and increasing security.

Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics is the easiest way to transform and analyze streaming data in real-time with Apache Flink. Apache Flink is an open source framework and engine for processing data streams. Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics reduces the complexity of building, managing, and integrating Apache Flink applications with other AWS services.

Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics provides built-in functions to filter, aggregate, and transform streaming data for advanced analytics. It processes streaming data with sub-second latencies, enabling you to analyze and respond to incoming data and events in real-time.

Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics is serverless; there are no servers to manage. It runs your streaming applications without requiring you to provision or manage any infrastructure. Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics automatically scales the infrastructure up and down as required to process incoming data.

Incorrect options:

<strong>Use Kinesis Data Streams to ingest data and Kinesis Data Analytics to generate leaderboard scores and time-series analytics</strong> - Amazon Kinesis Data Streams (KDS) is a massively scalable and durable real-time data streaming service. KDS can continuously capture gigabytes of data per second from hundreds of thousands of sources such as website clickstreams, database event streams, financial transactions, social media feeds, IT logs, and location-tracking events. The data collected is available in milliseconds to enable real-time analytics use cases such as real-time dashboards, real-time anomaly detection, dynamic pricing, and more.

Kinesis Data Streams needs manual provisioning of shards and a planning of shard requirements. The use-case clearly states that the company wants a fully managed solution as soon as possible with minimal effort. Kinesis Firehose is fully managed and requires no user input in provisioning of resources.

<strong>Use Kinesis Data Streams to ingest data and Amazon Kinesis Client Library to the application logic to generate leaderboard scores and time-series analytics</strong> - The Amazon Kinesis Client Library (KCL) is a pre-built library that helps you build consumer applications for reading and processing data from an Amazon Kinesis data stream. The KCL handles complex issues such as adapting to changes in data stream volume, load balancing streaming data, coordinating distributed services, and processing data with fault-tolerance. The KCL enables you to focus on business logic while building applications.

If you want a fully managed solution and you want to use SQL to process the data from your data stream, you should use Kinesis Data Analytics. Use KCL if you need to build a custom processing solution whose requirements are not met by Kinesis Data Analytics, and you can manage the resulting consumer application.

<strong>Use Kinesis Firehose to ingest data and Amazon Athena to generate leaderboard scores and time-series analytics</strong> - Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL. Athena is serverless, so there is no infrastructure to manage, and you pay only for the queries that you run. Athena is used for running analytics on S3 based data. For running analytics on real-time streaming data, Kinesis Data Analytics is the right fit.

37:T77e,Correct option:

<strong>The put data calls will be rejected with a ProvisionedThroughputExceeded exception</strong>

The capacity limits of an Amazon Kinesis data stream are defined by the number of shards within the data stream. The limits can be exceeded by either data throughput or the number of PUT records. While the capacity limits are exceeded, the put data call will be rejected with a ProvisionedThroughputExceeded exception. If this is due to a temporary rise of the data stream’s input data rate, retry by the data producer will eventually lead to completion of the requests. If this is due to a sustained rise of the data stream’s input data rate, you should increase the number of shards within your data stream to provide enough capacity for the put data calls to consistently succeed.

Incorrect options:

<strong>The put data calls will be rejected with a AccessDeniedException exception once the limit is reached</strong> - Access Denied error is thrown when the accessing system does not have enough permissions. Since data was getting ingested into Data Streams before reaching the capacity, this error is not possible.

<strong>Data is lost unless the partition key of the data records is changed in order to write data to a different shard in the stream</strong> - Partition key is used to segregate and route records to different shards of a data stream. A partition key is specified by your data producer while adding data to an Amazon Kinesis data stream. The use case talks about provisioning only one shard. It is not possible to set up more shards by simply changing the partition key. Hence, this choice is incorrect.

<strong>Contact AWS support to request an increase in the number of shards</strong> - This is a made-up option that acts as a distractor.

<strong>If you delete a bucket and immediately list all buckets, the deleted bucket might still appear in the list</strong> - Bucket configurations have an eventual consistency model. If you delete a bucket and immediately list all buckets, the deleted bucket might still appear in the list.

<strong>A process deletes an existing object and immediately tries to read it. Amazon S3 will not return any data as the object has been deleted</strong> - Amazon S3 provides strong read-after-write consistency for PUTs and DELETEs of objects in your Amazon S3 bucket in all AWS Regions. This applies to both writes to new objects as well as PUTs that overwrite existing objects and DELETEs.

<strong>A process deletes an existing object and immediately lists keys within its bucket. The object could still be visible for few more minutes till the change propagates</strong>

<strong>A process deletes an existing object and immediately tries to read it. Amazon S3 can return data as the object deletion has not yet propagated completely</strong> -

These two options highlight an eventually consistent behavior. Amazon S3 is now strongly consistent and will not return any data as the object has been deleted. So both these options are incorrect.

<strong>A process replaces an existing object and immediately tries to read it. Amazon S3 might return the old data</strong> - Amazon S3 will return the new data.

You can use query string conditions to configure rules that route requests based on key/value pairs or values in the query string. The match evaluation is not case-sensitive. The following wildcard characters are supported: * (matches 0 or more characters) and ? (matches exactly 1 character). You can specify conditions when you create or modify a rule.

Query parameters are often used along with the path component of the URL for applying a special logic to the resource being fetched.

The query string component starts after the first "?" in a URI. Typically query strings contain key-value pairs separated by a delimiter "&". Example: http://example.com/path/to/page?version=A&gender=female

The example condition given in the question is satisfied by requests with a query string that includes either a key/value pair of "version=v1" or any key set to "example".

<strong>HTTP 503</strong> - HTTP 503 indicates 'Service unavailable' error. This error in ALB is an indicator of the target groups for the load balancer having no registered targets.

Incorrect options:

<strong>HTTP 500</strong> - HTTP 500 indicates 'Internal server' error. There are several reasons for their error: A client submitted a request without an HTTP protocol, and the load balancer was unable to generate a redirect URL, there was an error executing the web ACL rules.

<strong>HTTP 504</strong> - HTTP 504 is 'Gateway timeout' error. Several reasons for this error, to quote a few: The load balancer failed to establish a connection to the target before the connection timeout expired, The load balancer established a connection to the target but the target did not respond before the idle timeout period elapsed.

<strong>HTTP 403</strong> - HTTP 403 is 'Forbidden' error. You configured an AWS WAF web access control list (web ACL) to monitor requests to your Application Load Balancer and it blocked a request.

<strong>Run AWS CodeBuild locally using CodeBuild Agent</strong>

AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed build service. There are no servers to provision and scale, or software to install, configure, and operate.

With the Local Build support for AWS CodeBuild, you just specify the location of your source code, choose your build settings, and CodeBuild runs build scripts for compiling, testing, and packaging your code. You can use the AWS CodeBuild agent to test and debug builds on a local machine.

By building an application on a local machine you can:

Test the integrity and contents of a buildspec file locally.

Test and build an application locally before committing.

Identify and fix errors quickly from your local development environment.

Incorrect options:

<strong>SSH into the CodeBuild Docker container</strong> - It is not possible to SSH into the CodeBuild Docker container, that's why you should test and fix errors locally.

<strong>Freeze the CodeBuild during its next execution</strong> - You cannot freeze the CodeBuild process but you can stop it. Please see more details on - <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/stop-build.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/stop-build.html</a>

<strong>Enable detailed monitoring</strong> - Detailed monitoring is available for EC2 instances. You do not enable detailed monitoring but you can specify output logs to be captured via CloudTrail.

AWS CodeBuild is integrated with AWS CloudTrail, a service that provides a record of actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service in CodeBuild. CloudTrail captures all API calls for CodeBuild as events, including calls from the CodeBuild console and from code calls to the CodeBuild APIs. If you create a trail, you can enable continuous delivery of CloudTrail events to an S3 bucket, including events for CodeBuild.

<strong>Instance might be part of Auto Scaling Group and hence re-launched similar instance</strong> - Auto Scaling groups can be configured to launch an instance to replace an instance that is undergoing maintenance. This could have been the reason why an instance of the same type got launched automatically. The size of an Auto Scaling group depends on the number of instances that you set as the desired capacity. If you wish to terminate an instance that is part of Auto Scaling Group, the configuration of the group should be changed to a reduced number of instances, so the automatic launch of instances does not happen when an unwanted instance is terminated.

Incorrect options:

<strong>The user did not have the right permissions to shutdown the instance. User needs root permissions to terminate an instance</strong> - This is an incorrect statement. If the user does not have enough permissions, then the action itself is unavailable for him. A user does not need root permissions to terminate an EC2 instance.

<strong>The instance could have been a part of the Application Load Balancer and hence was automatically started</strong> - Application Load Balancer is used to balance the incoming traffic requests equally among the available EC2 instances so keep the performance and availability at its best. ALBs are configured with Auto Scaling Groups, but this is not specified in the use-case. In the absence of Auto Scaling Group, ALB cannot launch instances by itself.

<strong>The instance could have been a part of Network Load Balancer and hence was automatically started</strong> - As explained above for ALB, a Network Load Balancer is not capable of launching instances by itself if it's not configured with an Auto Scaling Group.

<strong>Use CloudWatch Event Rules</strong>

Amazon CloudWatch Events is a web service that monitors your AWS resources and the applications you run on AWS. You can use Amazon CloudWatch Events to detect and react to changes in the state of a pipeline, stage, or action. Then, based on rules you create, CloudWatch Events invokes one or more target actions when a pipeline, stage, or action enters the state you specify in a rule.
Examples of Amazon CloudWatch Events rules and targets:

<ol>
<li>A rule that sends a notification when the instance state changes, where an EC2 instance is the event source, and Amazon SNS is the event target.</li>
<li>A rule that sends a notification when the build phase changes, where a CodeBuild configuration is the event source, and Amazon SNS is the event target.</li>
<li>A rule that detects pipeline changes and invokes an AWS Lambda function.</li>
</ol>

Incorrect options:

<strong>Use CloudTrail Event rules with Amazon Simple Email Service (SES)</strong> - This is an incorrect statement. There is no such thing as CloudTrail Event Rule.

<strong>Use Lambda function with Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)</strong> - Lambda functions can be triggered by the use of CloudWatch Event Rules as discussed above. AWS CodePipeline does not trigger Lambda functions directly.

<strong>Use Lambda Event Rules</strong> - This is an incorrect statement. There is no such thing as Lambda Event Rule.

<strong>KMS encryption for data at rest</strong>

<strong>Encryption in flight with HTTPS endpoint</strong>

Server-side encryption is a feature in Amazon Kinesis Data Streams that automatically encrypts data before it's at rest by using an AWS KMS customer master key (CMK) you specify. Data is encrypted before it's written to the Kinesis stream storage layer and decrypted after it's retrieved from storage. As a result, your data is encrypted at rest within the Kinesis Data Streams service. Also, the HTTPS protocol ensures that data inflight is encrypted as well.

Incorrect options:

<strong>SSE-C encryption</strong> - SSE-C is functionality in Amazon S3 where S3 encrypts your data, on your behalf, using keys that you provide. This does not apply for the given use-case.

<strong>Client-Side Encryption</strong> - This involves code changes, so the option is incorrect.

<strong>Envelope Encryption</strong> - This involves code changes, so the option is incorrect.

3f:T802,Correct option:

<strong>A process replaces an existing object and immediately tries to read it. Amazon S3 always returns the latest version of the object</strong>

Amazon S3 delivers strong read-after-write consistency automatically, without changes to performance or availability, without sacrificing regional isolation for applications, and at no additional cost.

After a successful write of a new object or an overwrite of an existing object, any subsequent read request immediately receives the latest version of the object. S3 also provides strong consistency for list operations, so after a write, you can immediately perform a listing of the objects in a bucket with any changes reflected.

Strong read-after-write consistency helps when you need to immediately read an object after a write. For example, strong read-after-write consistency when you often read and list immediately after writing objects.

To summarize, all S3 GET, PUT, and LIST operations, as well as operations that change object tags, ACLs, or metadata, are strongly consistent. What you write is what you will read, and the results of a LIST will be an accurate reflection of what’s in the bucket.

Incorrect options:

<strong>A process replaces an existing object and immediately tries to read it. Until the change is fully propagated, Amazon S3 might return the previous data</strong>

<strong>A process replaces an existing object and immediately tries to read it. Until the change is fully propagated, Amazon S3 does not return any data</strong>

<strong>A process replaces an existing object and immediately tries to read it. Until the change is fully propagated, Amazon S3 might return the new data</strong>

These three options contradict the earlier details provided in the explanation.

<strong>CodeDeploy Deployment Groups</strong>

You can specify one or more deployment groups for a CodeDeploy application. The deployment group contains settings and configurations used during the deployment. Most deployment group settings depend on the compute platform used by your application. Some settings, such as rollbacks, triggers, and alarms can be configured for deployment groups for any compute platform.

In an EC2/On-Premises deployment, a deployment group is a set of individual instances targeted for deployment. A deployment group contains individually tagged instances, Amazon EC2 instances in Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups, or both.

Incorrect options:

<strong>CodeDeploy Agent</strong> - The CodeDeploy agent is a software package that, when installed and configured on an instance, makes it possible for that instance to be used in CodeDeploy deployments. The agent connects the EC2 instances to the CodeDeploy service.

<strong>CodeDeploy Hooks</strong> - Hooks are found in the AppSec file used by AWS CodeDeploy to manage deployment. Hooks correspond to lifecycle events such as ApplicationStart, ApplicationStop, etc. to which you can assign a script.

<strong>Define multiple CodeDeploy Applications</strong> - This option has been added as a distractor. Instead, you want to use deployment groups to use the same deployment and maybe separate the times when a group of instances receives the software updates.

41:T570,Correct option:

<strong>The load balancer is highly available and its public IP may change. The DNS name is constant</strong>

When your load balancer is created, it receives a public DNS name that clients can use to send requests. The DNS servers resolve the DNS name of your load balancer to the public IP addresses of the load balancer nodes for your load balancer. Never resolve the IP of a load balancer as it can change with time. You should always use the DNS name.

Incorrect options:

<strong>Your security groups are not stable</strong> - You security groups to allow your load balancer to work with registered instances. It is stable if set correctly. If your application is working and stops after a while, the issue is not with the security groups.

<strong>You need to enable stickiness</strong> - This enables the load balancer to bind a user's session to a specific instance, so this has no impact on the issue described in the given use-case.

<strong>You need to disable multi-AZ deployments</strong> - This has been added as a distractor and this has no bearing on the use-case. The change is happening with the IP of the load balancer.

42:Tcac,Correct option:

<strong>Deploy the API versions as unique stages with unique endpoints and use stage variables to provide the context to identify the API versions</strong> - A stage is a named reference to a deployment, which is a snapshot of the API. You use a Stage to manage and optimize a particular deployment. For example, you can configure stage settings to enable caching, customize request throttling, configure logging, define stage variables, or attach a canary release for testing.

Stage variables are name-value pairs that you can define as configuration attributes associated with a deployment stage of a REST API. They act like environment variables and can be used in your API setup and mapping templates.

With deployment stages in API Gateway, you can manage multiple release stages for each API, such as alpha, beta, and production. Using stage variables you can configure an API deployment stage to interact with different backend endpoints.

For example, your API can pass a GET request as an HTTP proxy to the backend web host (for example, http://example.com). In this case, the backend web host is configured in a stage variable so that when developers call your production endpoint, API Gateway calls example.com. When you call your beta endpoint, API Gateway uses the value configured in the stage variable for the beta stage, and calls a different web host (for example, beta.example.com). Similarly, stage variables can be used to specify a different AWS Lambda function name for each stage in your API.

Incorrect options:

<strong>Use an X-Version header to identify which version is being called and pass that header to the Lambda function</strong> - This is an invalid option, given only as a distractor.

<strong>Use an API Gateway Lambda authorizer to route API clients to the correct API version</strong> - A Lambda authorizer is an API Gateway feature that uses a Lambda function to control access to your API. A Lambda authorizer is useful if you want to implement a custom authorization scheme that uses a bearer token authentication strategy such as OAuth or SAML, or that uses request parameters to determine the caller's identity.

<strong>Set up an API Gateway resource policy to identify the API versions and provide context to the Lambda function</strong> - Amazon API Gateway resource policies are JSON policy documents that you attach to an API to control whether a specified principal (typically an IAM user or role) can invoke the API. You can use API Gateway resource policies to allow your API to be securely invoked requestors. They are not meant for choosing the version of APIs.

43:T10e0,Correct option:

<strong>Develop an AWS Lambda authorizer that references the DynamoDB authentication table</strong> - A Lambda authorizer is an API Gateway feature that uses a Lambda function to control access to your API.

A Lambda authorizer is useful if you want to implement a custom authorization scheme that uses a bearer token authentication strategy such as OAuth or SAML, or that uses request parameters to determine the caller's identity.

When a client makes a request to one of your API's methods, API Gateway calls your Lambda authorizer, which takes the caller's identity as input and returns an IAM policy as output.

There are two types of Lambda authorizers:

<ol>
<li>A token-based Lambda authorizer (also called a TOKEN authorizer) receives the caller's identity in a bearer token, such as a JSON Web Token (JWT) or an OAuth token.</li>
<li>A request parameter-based Lambda authorizer (also called a REQUEST authorizer) receives the caller's identity in a combination of headers, query string parameters, state variables, and $context variables.</li>
</ol>

Incorrect options:

<strong>Set up an API Gateway Model that requires the credentials, then grant API Gateway access to the authentication table in DynamoDB</strong> - In API Gateway, a model defines the data structure of a payload. In API Gateway models are defined using the JSON schema draft 4. Models are not mandatory.

<strong>Update the API Gateway integration requests to require the credentials, then grant API Gateway access to the authentication table in DynamoDB</strong> - After setting up an API method, you must integrate it with an endpoint in the backend. A backend endpoint is also referred to as an integration endpoint and can be a Lambda function, an HTTP webpage, or an AWS service action.

An integration request is an HTTP request that API Gateway submits to the backend, passing along the client-submitted request data, and transforming the data, if necessary. The HTTP method (or verb) and URI of the integration request are dictated by the backend (that is, the integration endpoint). They can be the same as or different from the method request's HTTP method and URI, respectively.

<strong>Authorize using Amazon Cognito that will reference the authentication table of DynamoDB</strong> - As an alternative to using IAM roles and policies or Lambda authorizers (formerly known as custom authorizers), you can use an Amazon Cognito user pool to control who can access your API in Amazon API Gateway.

To use an Amazon Cognito user pool with your API, you must first create an authorizer of the COGNITO_USER_POOLS type and then configure an API method to use that authorizer. After the API is deployed, the client must first sign the user in to the user pool, obtain an identity or access token for the user, and then call the API method with one of the tokens, which are typically set to the request's Authorization header. The API call succeeds only if the required token is supplied and the supplied token is valid, otherwise, the client isn't authorized to make the call because the client did not have credentials that could be authorized.

<strong>S3</strong>

If you upload a local template file, AWS CloudFormation uploads it to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket in your AWS account. If you don't already have an S3 bucket that was created by AWS CloudFormation, it creates a unique bucket for each region in which you upload a template file. If you already have an S3 bucket that was created by AWS CloudFormation in your AWS account, AWS CloudFormation adds the template to that bucket.

Incorrect options:

<strong>EBS</strong> - An Amazon EBS volume is a durable, block-level storage device that you can attach to your instances. After you attach a volume to an instance, you can use it as you would use a physical hard drive. EBS volumes are flexible. Amazon EBS is a recommended storage option when data must be quickly accessible and requires long-term persistence. EBS cannot be used for selecting a stack template for CloudFormation.

<strong>EFS</strong> - EFS is a file storage service where you mount the file system on an Amazon EC2 Linux-based instance which is not an option for CloudFormation.

<strong>ECR</strong> - Amazon ECR eliminates the need to operate your container repositories or worry about scaling the underlying infrastructure which does not apply to CloudFormation.

45:T638,Correct option:

<strong>The IAM permissions are wrong for the CodeBuild service</strong>

You can push your Docker or Open Container Initiative (OCI) images to an Amazon ECR repository with the docker push command.

Amazon ECR users require permission to call ecr:GetAuthorizationToken before they can authenticate to a registry and push or pull any images from any Amazon ECR repository. Amazon ECR provides several managed policies to control user access at varying levels

Incorrect options:

<strong>The ECR repository is stale, you must delete and re-create it</strong> - You can delete a repository when you are done using it, stale is not a concept within ECR. This option has been added as a distractor.

<strong>CodeBuild cannot talk to ECR because of security group issues</strong> - A security group acts as a virtual firewall at the instance level and it is not related to pushing Docker images, so this option does not fit the given use-case.

<strong>The ECS instances are misconfigured and must contain additional data in /etc/ecs/ecs.config</strong> - The error Authorization is an indication that there is an access issue, therefore you should not look at your configuration first but rather permissions.

<strong>30</strong>

A write capacity unit represents one write per second, for an item up to 1 KB in size.

Item sizes for writes are rounded up to the next 1 KB multiple. For example, writing a 500-byte item consumes the same throughput as writing a 1 KB item. So, for the given use-case, each object is of size 4.5 KB, which will be rounded up to 5KB.

Therefore, for 6 objects, you need 6x5 = 30 WCUs.

Incorrect options:

<strong>24</strong>

<strong>15</strong>

<strong>46</strong>

These three options contradict the details provided in the explanation above, so these are incorrect.

47:T598,Correct option:

<strong>Look into the X-Forwarded-For header in the backend</strong>

The X-Forwarded-For request header helps you identify the IP address of a client when you use an HTTP or HTTPS load balancer. Because load balancers intercept traffic between clients and servers, your server access logs contain only the IP address of the load balancer. To see the IP address of the client, use the X-Forwarded-For request header. Elastic Load Balancing stores the IP address of the client in the X-Forwarded-For request header and passes the header to your server.

Incorrect options:

<strong>Modify the front-end of the website so that the users send their IP in the requests</strong> - When a user makes a request the IP address is sent with the request to the server and the load balancer intercepts it. There is no need to modify the application.

<strong>Look into the X-Forwarded-Proto header in the backend</strong> - The X-Forwarded-Proto request header helps you identify the protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) that a client used to connect to your load balancer.

<strong>Look into the client's cookie</strong> - For this, we would need to modify the client-side logic and server-side logic, which would not be efficient.

48:Tb5f,Correct option:

<strong>Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances</strong> - Reserved instances can provide a capacity reservation, offering additional confidence in your ability to launch the number of instances you have reserved when you need them. You save money going with Reserved instances vs on-demand especially in a year's worth of time.

Reserved Instances are not physical instances, but rather a billing discount applied to the use of On-Demand Instances in your account. These On-Demand Instances must match certain attributes, such as instance type and Region, to benefit from the billing discount. So, there is no performance difference between an On-Demand instance or a Reserved instance.

via - <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-reserved-instances.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-reserved-instances.html</a>

Incorrect options:

<strong>Amazon EC2 Spot Instances</strong> - A Spot Instance is an unused EC2 instance that is available for less than the On-Demand price. Because Spot Instances enable you to request unused EC2 instances at steep discounts, you can lower your Amazon EC2 costs significantly. Spot instances are useful if your applications can be interrupted, like data analysis, batch jobs, background processing, and optional tasks. Spot instances can be pulled down anytime without prior notice. Hence, not the right choice for the current scenario.

<strong>Amazon EC2 On-Demand Instances</strong> - With On-Demand Instances, you pay for compute capacity by the second with no long-term commitments. You have full control over its lifecycle—you decide when to launch, stop, hibernate, start, reboot, or terminate it. But, On-Demand instances cost a lot more than Reserved instances. Here, in our use case, we already know that the systems are required for a complete year, so making use of Reserved Instances discount makes a lot more sense.

<strong>On-premise EC2 instance</strong> - On-premise implies the client has to maintain the physical machines, their capacity provisioning and maintenance. Not an option when the client is planning to move to AWS Cloud.

49:T809,Correct option:

When an instance terminates, the value of the DeleteOnTermination attribute for each attached EBS volume determines whether to preserve or delete the volume. By default, the DeleteOnTermination attribute is set to True for the root volume and is set to False for all other volume types.

<strong>Set the DeleteOnTermination attribute to False using the command line</strong> - If the instance is already running, you can set DeleteOnTermination to False using the command line.

Incorrect options:

<strong>Update the attribute using AWS management console. Select the EC2 instance and then uncheck the Delete On Termination check box for the root EBS volume</strong> - You can set the DeleteOnTermination attribute to False when you launch a new instance. It is not possible to update this attribute of a running instance from the AWS console.

<strong>Set the DisableApiTermination attribute of the instance using the API</strong> - By default, you can terminate your instance using the Amazon EC2 console, command-line interface, or API. To prevent your instance from being accidentally terminated using Amazon EC2, you can enable termination protection for the instance. The DisableApiTermination attribute controls whether the instance can be terminated using the console, CLI, or API. This option cannot be used to control the delete status for the EBS volume when the instance terminates.

<strong>The attribute cannot be updated when the instance is running. Stop the instance from Amazon EC2 console and then update the flag</strong> - This statement is wrong and given only as a distractor.

4a:Tc15,Correct options:

<strong>RDS applies OS updates by performing maintenance on the standby, then promoting the standby to primary, and finally performing maintenance on the old primary, which becomes the new standby</strong>

Running a DB instance as a Multi-AZ deployment can further reduce the impact of a maintenance event because Amazon RDS applies operating system updates by following these steps:

Perform maintenance on the standby.

Promote the standby to primary.

Perform maintenance on the old primary, which becomes the new standby.

When you modify the database engine for your DB instance in a Multi-AZ deployment, then Amazon RDS upgrades both the primary and secondary DB instances at the same time. In this case, the database engine for the entire Multi-AZ deployment is shut down during the upgrade.

<strong>Amazon RDS automatically initiates a failover to the standby, in case the primary database fails for any reason</strong> - You also benefit from enhanced database availability when running your DB instance as a Multi-AZ deployment. If an Availability Zone failure or DB instance failure occurs, your availability impact is limited to the time automatic failover takes to complete.

Another implied benefit of running your DB instance as a Multi-AZ deployment is that DB instance failover is automatic and requires no administration. In an Amazon RDS context, this means you are not required to monitor DB instance events and initiate manual DB instance recovery in the event of an Availability Zone failure or DB instance failure.

Incorrect options:

<strong>For automated backups, I/O activity is suspended on your primary DB since backups are not taken from standby DB</strong> - The availability benefits of Multi-AZ also extend to planned maintenance. For example, with automated backups, I/O activity is no longer suspended on your primary during your preferred backup window, since backups are taken from the standby.

<strong>To enhance read scalability, a Multi-AZ standby instance can be used to serve read requests</strong> - A Multi-AZ standby cannot serve read requests. Multi-AZ deployments are designed to provide enhanced database availability and durability, rather than read scaling benefits. As such, the feature uses synchronous replication between primary and standby. AWS implementation makes sure the primary and the standby are constantly in sync, but precludes using the standby for read or write operations.

<strong>Updates to your DB Instance are asynchronously replicated across the Availability Zone to the standby in order to keep both in sync</strong> - When you create your DB instance to run as a Multi-AZ deployment, Amazon RDS automatically provisions and maintains a synchronous “standby” replica in a different Availability Zone. Updates to your DB Instance are synchronously replicated across the Availability Zone to the standby in order to keep both in sync and protect your latest database updates against DB instance failure.

4b:T4bb,Correct option:

<strong>SSE-S3</strong>

Using Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3), each object is encrypted with a unique key employing strong multi-factor encryption. As an additional safeguard, it encrypts the key itself with a master key that it regularly rotates. Amazon S3 server-side encryption uses one of the strongest block ciphers available, 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256), to encrypt your data.

Incorrect options:

<strong>SSE-C</strong> - You manage the encryption keys and Amazon S3 manages the encryption as it writes to disks and decryption when you access your objects.

<strong>Client-Side Encryption</strong> - You can encrypt data client-side and upload the encrypted data to Amazon S3. In this case, you manage the encryption process, the encryption keys, and related tools.

<strong>SSE-KMS</strong> - Similar to SSE-S3 and also provides you with an audit trail of when your key was used and by whom. Additionally, you have the option to create and manage encryption keys yourself.

4c:T8b0,Correct option:

<strong>Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) Standard–IA storage class</strong> - Amazon EFS is a file storage service for use with Amazon compute (EC2, containers, serverless) and on-premises servers. Amazon EFS provides a file system interface, file system access semantics (such as strong consistency and file locking), and concurrently accessible storage for up to thousands of Amazon EC2 instances.

The Standard–IA storage class reduces storage costs for files that are not accessed every day. It does this without sacrificing the high availability, high durability, elasticity, and POSIX file system access that Amazon EFS provides. AWS recommends Standard-IA storage if you need your full dataset to be readily accessible and want to automatically save on storage costs for files that are less frequently accessed.

Incorrect options:

<strong>Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) storage class</strong> - Amazon S3 is an object storage service. Amazon S3 makes data available through an Internet API that can be accessed anywhere. It is not a file storage service, as is needed in the use case.

<strong>Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) Standard storage class</strong> - Amazon EFS Standard storage classes are ideal for workloads that require the highest levels of durability and availability. The EFS Standard storage class is used for frequently accessed files. It is the storage class to which customer data is initially written for Standard storage classes. The company is also looking at cutting costs by optimally storing the infrequently accessed data. Hence, EFS standard storage class is not the right solution for the given use case.

<strong>Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)</strong> - Amazon EBS is a block-level storage service for use with Amazon EC2. Amazon EBS can deliver performance for workloads that require the lowest latency access to data from a single EC2 instance. EBS volume cannot be accessed by hundreds of EC2 instances concurrently. It is not a file storage service, as is needed in the use case.

4d:T483,Correct option:

<strong>test.sample.com</strong> - You can use host conditions to define rules that route requests based on the hostname in the host header (also known as host-based routing). This enables you to support multiple subdomains and different top-level domains using a single load balancer.

A hostname is not case-sensitive, can be up to 128 characters in length, and can contain any of the following characters:
1. A–Z, a–z, 0–9
2. - .
3. * (matches 0 or more characters)
4. ? (matches exactly 1 character)

You must include at least one "." character. You can include only alphabetical characters after the final "." character.

The rule *.sample.com matches test.sample.com but doesn't match sample.com.

Incorrect options:

<strong>sample.com</strong>

<strong>sample.test.com</strong>

<strong>SAMPLE.COM</strong>

These three options contradict the explanation provided above, so these options are incorrect.
