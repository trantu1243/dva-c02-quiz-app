data is protected when you encrypt it, but you have to protect your encryption key. One strategy is to encrypt it. Envelope encryption is the practice of encrypting plaintext data with a data key and then encrypting the data key under another key. You can even encrypt the data encryption key under another encryption key and encrypt that encryption key under another encryption key. But, eventually, one key must remain in plaintext so you can decrypt the keys and your data. This top-level plaintext key-encryption key is known as the master key. Envelope encryption offers several benefits: Protecting data keysWhen you encrypt a data key, you don't have to worry about storing the encrypted data key, because the data key is inherently protected by encryption. You can safely store the encrypted data key alongside the encrypted data. Encrypting the same data under multiple master keysEncryption operations can be time-consuming, particularly when the data being encrypted are large objects. Instead of re-encrypting raw data multiple times with different keys, you can re-encrypt only the data keys that protect the raw data. Combining the strengths of multiple algorithmsIn general, symmetric key algorithms are faster and produce smaller ciphertexts than public-key algorithms. But public-key algorithms provide inherent separation of roles and easier key management. Envelope encryption lets you combine the strengths of each strategy. To perform envelope encryption using KMS keys, you must first generate a data key using your KMS key and use its plaintext version to encrypt data. Hence, the correct answer is the option that says: Generate a data key using a KMS key. Then, encrypt data with the plaintext data key. The option that says: Generate a data key using a KMS key. Then, encrypt data with the ciphertext version data key is incorrect. A ciphertext data key cannot be used for encryption because it is an encrypted version of the data key. You must use the plaintext version of the data key. The option that says: Use a KMS key for encryption and decryption is incorrect. KMS keys can only be used to encrypt data up to 4KB in size, making it not suitable for encrypting documents. The option that says: Use a combination of symmetric and asymmetric encryption. Encrypt the data with a symmetric key and use the asymmetric private key to decrypt the data is incorrect because the keys on each encryption algorithm are separate entities and are in no way related. You cannot encrypt data with a symmetric key and expect it to be decrypted by an asymmetric private key.

If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-Operation. Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation. Hence, the correct answer is: Add the --dry-run parameter to the describe-instances command The option that says: Add the --generate-cli-skeleton parameter to the describe-instances command is incorrect because this is a parameter that will generate and display a parameter template that you can customize and use as input on a later command. The generated template includes all of the parameters that the command supports. The option that says: Add the --filters parameter to the describe-instances command is incorrect. Use this parameter if you want to get only the details that you like from the output of your command. It will not help you check for the permission required to initiate the command.

In this case, the Lambda functions invoke one another, creating a large state machine. AWS Step Functions lets you coordinate multiple AWS services into serverless workflows so you can build and update apps quickly. Using Step Functions, you can design and run workflows that stitch together services, such as AWS Lambda, AWS Fargate, and Amazon SageMaker, into feature-rich applications. Step Functions automatically triggers and tracks each step, and retries when there are errors so your application executes in order and as expected. With Step Functions, you can craft long-running workflows such as machine learning model training, report generation, and IT automation. You can manage the coordination of a state machine in Step Functions using the Amazon States Language. The Amazon States Language is a JSON-based, structured language used to define your state machine, a collection of states, that can do work (Task states), determine which states to transition to next (Choice states), stop execution with an error (Fail states), and so on. Hence, the correct answer is Create an AWS Step Functions state machine and convert each Lambda function into individual Task states. The option that says: Use AWS CodePipeline to define the source, build, and deployment stages for each Lambda function is incorrect. While this approach can help with the deployment process, it does not directly address the coordination and dependency issues between the Lambda functions. AWS CodePipeline is primarily used for automating the build, test, and deploy phases of your release process every time there is a code change. The option that says: Create an AWS AppSync GraphQL API endpoint and configure each Lambda function as a resolver is incorrect. AWS AppSync is a service that enables you to query multiple sources from a single GraphQL API endpoint. While it provides features such as schema generation, resolvers, and real-time subscriptions, it is not specifically designed as a management tool for coordinating and managing the dependencies between multiple Lambda functions. The option that says: Use AWS AppConfig’s feature flag to gradually release new code changes to each Lambda function is incorrect. While this approach can help with rolling out new code changes, it does not directly address the coordination and dependency issues between the Lambda functions.

Use this command to quickly upload local artifacts that might be required by your template. After you package your template's artifacts, run the aws cloudformation deploy command to deploy the returned template. Since we have local artifacts (source code for the AWS Lambda functions), we should use the package command.

Hence, the correct answer is: Use the aws cloudformation package command and deploy using aws cloudformation deploy. The option that says: Use the aws cloudformation validate-template command and deploy using aws cloudformation deploy is incorrect because the validate-template command will just check the template if it is a valid JSON or YAML file. The option that says: Use the aws cloudformation deploy command is incorrect because the artifacts are located in the local computer and since the deploy command uses S3 as the location for artifacts that were defined in the Cloudformation template, using the deploy command alone will not work.

Individual states receive JSON as input and usually pass JSON as output to the next state. Understanding how this information flows from state to state and learning how to filter and manipulate this data is key to effectively designing and implementing workflows in AWS Step Functions. In the Amazon States Language, these fields filter and control the flow of JSON from state to state: - InputPath - OutputPath - ResultPath - Parameters Both the InputPath and Parameters fields provide a way to manipulate JSON as it moves through your workflow. InputPath can limit the input that is passed by filtering the JSON notation by using a path. The Parameters field enables you to pass a collection of key-value pairs, where the values are either static values that you define in your state machine definition, or that are selected from the input using a path. AWS Step Functions applies the InputPath field first, and then the Parameters field. You can first filter your raw input to a selection you want using InputPath, and then apply Parameters to manipulate that input further, or add new values. The output of a state can be a copy of its input, the result it produces (for example, the output from a Task state’s Lambda function), or a combination of its input and result. Use ResultPath to control which combination of these is passed to the state output. OutputPath enables you to select a portion of the state output to pass to the next state. This enables you to filter out unwanted information, and pass only the portion of JSON that you care about. Out of these field filters, the ResultPath field filter is the only one that can control input values and its previous results to be passed to the state output. Hence, the correct answer is: Declare a ResultPath field filter on the Amazon States Language specification. The option that says: Declare an InputPath field filter on the Amazon State Language specification is incorrect because it just operates on the input level by filtering the JSON notation by using a path. It cannot control both ends of a state (input and output). The option that says: Declare an OutputPath field filter on the Amazon State Language specification is incorrect because it just operates on the output level. It is used to filter out unwanted information and pass only the portion of JSON that you care about that will be passed onto the next state.

Amazon ElastiCache offers fully managed Redis and Memcached for most demanding applications that require sub-millisecond response times. However, Redis is the only service in Elasticache that supports replication. Hence, the correct answer is: Set up an Elasticache for Redis between the application and database. Configure it to run with replication to achieve high availability. The option that says: Convert the database schema using the AWS Schema Conversion Tool and move the data to DynamoDB.

An HTTP 400 status code indicates a problem with your request, such as authentication failure, missing required parameters, or exceeding a table's provisioned throughput. You have to fix the issue in your application before submitting the request again. ProvisionedThroughputExceededException means that your request rate is too high. The AWS SDKs for DynamoDB automatically retries requests that receive this exception. Your request is eventually successful unless your retry queue is too large to finish. To handle this error, you can reduce the frequency of requests using error retries and exponential backoff. Hence, the correct answer is: Reduce the frequency of requests using error retries and exponential backoff.

You pay only for the compute time you consume. With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service - all with zero administration. Just upload your code, and Lambda takes care of everything required to run and scale your code with high availability. You can set up your code to automatically trigger from other AWS services or call it directly from any web or mobile app. Lambda Throttling refers to the rejection of the Lambda function to invocation requests. At this event, the Lambda will return a throttling error exception which you need to handle. This happens because your current concurrency execution count is greater than your concurrency limit. Throttling is intended to protect your resources and downstream applications. Though Lambda automatically scales to accommodate your incoming traffic, your function can still be throttled for various reasons. The following are the recommended solutions to handle throttling issues: Configure reserved concurrency - by default, there are 900 unreserved concurrencies shared across all functions in a region. To prevent other functions from consuming the available concurrent executions, reserve a portion of it to your Lambda function based on the demand of your current workload. Use exponential backoff in your app - a technique that uses progressively longer waits between retries for consecutive error responses. This can be used to handle throttling issues by preventing collision between simultaneous requests. Use a dead-letter queue - If you're using Amazon S3 and Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events), configure your function with a dead letter queue to catch any events that are discarded due to constant throttles. This can protect your data if you're seeing significant throttling. Request a service quota increase - you can reach AWS support to request for a higher service quota for concurrent executions. Hence, the correct answers are: - Use exponential backoff in your application - Configure reserved concurrency - Request a service quota increase The option that says: Deploy the Lambda function in VPC is incorrect because this has nothing to do with fixing throttling errors. The only time you should do this is if you need to have a connection between a Lambda function and a resource running in your VPC. The option that says: Use a compiled language like GoLang to improve the function's performance is incorrect because no matter what language you use, the Lambda function will still throw a throttling error if the current concurrency execution count is greater than your concurrency limit.
