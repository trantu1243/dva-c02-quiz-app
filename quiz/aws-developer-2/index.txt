f:T595,You can send trace data to XRay in the form of segment documents. A segment document is a JSON formatted string that contains information about the work that your application does in service of a request. Your application can record data about the work that it does itself in segments, or work that uses downstream services and resources in subsegments.Segments record information about the work that your application does. A segment, at a minimum, records the time spent on a task, a name, and two IDs. The trace ID tracks the request as it travels between services. The segment ID tracks the work done for the request by a single service.Example Minimal complete segment:You can upload segment documents with the PutTraceSegments API. The API has a single parameter, TraceSegmentDocuments, that takes a list of JSON segment documents.Therefore, the Developer should use the PutTraceSegments API action.CORRECT: "The PutTraceSegments API action" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "The PutTelemetryRecords API action" is incorrect as this is used by the AWS XRay daemon to upload telemetry.INCORRECT: "The UpdateGroup API action" is incorrect as this updates a group resource.INCORRECT: "The GetTraceSummaries API action" is incorrect as this retrieves IDs and annotations for traces available for a specified time frame using an optional filter.References: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xrayapisendingdata.html10:T9f4,With provisioned capacity mode, you specify the number of data reads and writes per second that you require for your application.Read capacity unit (RCU):• Each API call to read data from your table is a read request.• Read requests can be strongly consistent, eventually consistent, or transactional.• For items up to 4 KB in size, one RCU can perform one strongly consistent read request per second.• Items larger than 4 KB require additional RCUs.• For items up to 4 KB in size, one RCU can perform two eventually consistent read requests per second.• Transactional read requests require two RCUs to perform one read per second for items up to 4 KB.• For example, a strongly consistent read of an 8 KB item would require two RCUs, an eventually consistent read of an 8 KB item would require one RCU, and a transactional read of an 8 KB item would require four RCUs.Write capacity unit (WCU):• Each API call to write data to your table is a write request.• For items up to 1 KB in size, one WCU can perform one standard write request per second.• Items larger than 1 KB require additional WCUs.• Transactional write requests require two WCUs to perform one write per second for items up to 1 KB.• For example, a standard write request of a 1 KB item would require one WCU, a standard write request of a 3 KB item would require three WCUs, and a transactional write request of a 3 KB item would require six WCUs.To determine the number of RCUs required to handle 4 strongly consistent reads per/second with an average item size of 9KB, perform the following steps:1. Determine the average item size by rounding up the next multiple of 4KB (9KB rounds up to 12KB).2. Determine the RCU per item by dividing the item size by 4KB (12KB/4KB = 3).3. Multiply the value from step 2 with the number of reads required per second (3x4 = 12).To determine the number of WCUs required to handle 2 standard writes per/second with an average item size of 9KB, simply multiply the average item size by the number of writes required (9x2=18).CORRECT: "12 RCU and 18 WCU" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "24 RCU and 18 WCU" is incorrect. This would be the correct answer for transactional reads and standard writes.INCORRECT: "12 RCU and 36 WCU" is incorrect. This would be the correct answer for strongly consistent reads and transactional writes.INCORRECT: "6 RCU and 18 WCU" is incorrect. This would be the correct answer for eventually consistent reads and standard writesReferences: https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/pricing/provisioned/11:T71c,The process of consuming messages from a queue depends on whether you use short or long polling. By default, Amazon SQS uses short polling, querying only a subset of its servers (based on a weighted random distribution) to determine whether any messages are available for a response.You can use long polling to reduce your costs while allowing your consumers to receive messages as soon as they arrive in the queue. When the wait time for the ReceiveMessage API action is greater than 0, long polling is in effect. The maximum long polling wait time is 20 seconds.Long polling helps reduce the cost of using Amazon SQS by eliminating the number of empty responses (when there are no messages available for a ReceiveMessage request) and false empty responses (when messages are available but aren't included in a response). It also returns messages as soon as they become available.CORRECT: "Retrieve the messages from the queue using long polling every 15 seconds" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "Retrieve the messages from the queue using short polling every 10 seconds" is incorrect as short polling is configured when the WaitTimeSeconds parameter of a ReceiveMessage request is set to 0. Any number above zero indicates long polling is in effect.INCORRECT: "Reduce the size of the messages with compression before sending them" is incorrect as this will not mean messages are picked up earlier and there is no reason to compress messages that are 4 KB in size.INCORRECT: "Store the message payload in Amazon S3 and use the SQS Extended Client Library for Java" is incorrect as this is unnecessary for messages of this size and will also not result in the shortest delay when updating the leaderboard.References: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqsshortandlongpolling.html12:T645,To serve a static website hosted on Amazon S3, you can deploy a CloudFront distribution using one of these configurations:• Using a REST API endpoint as the origin with access restricted by an origin access identity (OAI)• Using a website endpoint as the origin with anonymous (public) access allowed• Using a website endpoint as the origin with access restricted by a Referer headerAll assets of this website are static (HTML, images, clientside JavaScript), therefore this website is compatible with both S3 static websites and Amazon CloudFront. The simplest way to minimize latency is to create a CloudFront distribution and configure the static website as an origin.CORRECT: "Create a CloudFront distribution and configure the S3 website as an origin" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "Host the website from multiple buckets around the world and use Route 53 geolocationbased routing" is incorrect as this not a good way to solve this problem. With this configuration you would need to keep multiple copies of the website files in sync (and pay for more storage space) which is less than ideal.INCORRECT: "Enable S3 transfer acceleration" is incorrect as transfer acceleration is used for improving the speed of uploads to an S3 bucket, not downloads.INCORRECT: "Create an ElastiCache cluster and configure the S3 website as an origin" is incorrect as you cannot use an ElastiCache cluster as the frontend to an S3 static website (nor does it solve the problem of reducing latency around the world).References: https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledgecenter/cloudfrontservestaticwebsite/13:T7e3,You need to configure your Git client to communicate with CodeCommit repositories. As part of this configuration, you provide IAM credentials that CodeCommit can use to authenticate you. IAM supports CodeCommit with three types of credentials:• Git credentials, an IAM generated user name and password pair you can use to communicate with CodeCommit repositories over HTTPS.• SSH keys, a locally generated publicprivate key pair that you can associate with your IAM user to communicate with CodeCommit repositories over SSH.• AWS access keys, which you can use with the credential helper included with the AWS CLI to communicate with CodeCommit repositories over HTTPS.As the Developer is going to use SSH, he first needs to generate an SSH private and public key. These can then be used for authentication. The method of creating these depends on the operating system the Developer is using. Then, the Developer can upload the public key (by copying the contents of the file) into his IAM account under security credentials.CORRECT: "Generate an SSH public and private key. Upload the public key to the Developer’s IAM account" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "On the Developer’s IAM account, under security credentials, choose to create HTTPS Git credentials for AWS CodeCommit" is incorrect as this method is used for creating credentials when you want to connect to CodeCommit using HTTPS.INCORRECT: "Create an account on Github and user those login credentials to login to AWS CodeCommit" is incorrect as you cannot login to AWS CodeCommit using credentials from Github.INCORRECT: "On the Developer’s IAM account, under security credentials, choose to create an access key and secret ID" is incorrect as though you can use access keys to authenticated to CodeCommit, this requires the credential helper, and enables access over HTTPS.References:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_sshkeys.html https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/settingupsshunixes.html14:T5c5,If you would like to run a Docker image that is available in Amazon ECR, you can pull it to your local environment with the docker pull command. You can do this from either your default registry or from a registry associated with another AWS account.Docker CLI does not support standard AWS authentication methods, so client authentication must be handled so that ECR knows who is requesting to push or pull an image. To do this you can issue the aws ecr getlogin or aws ecr getloginpassword (AWS CLI v2) and then use the output to login using docker login and then issue a docker pull command specifying the image name using registry/repository[:tag]CORRECT: "Run aws ecr getloginpassword use the output to login in then issue a docker pull command specifying the image name using registry/repository[:tag]" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "Run the docker pull command specifying the image name using registry/repository[:tag]" is incorrect as you first need to authenticate to get an access token so you can pull the image down.INCORRECT: "Run aws ecr describeimages repositoryname repositoryname" is incorrect as this would just list the images available in the repository.INCORRECT: "Run docker login with an IAM key pair then issue a docker pull command specifying the image name using registry/repository[@digest]" is incorrect as you cannot run docker login with an IAM key pair.References: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/dockerpullecrimage.html15:T5c3,A task placement constraint is a rule that is considered during task placement. Task placement constraints can be specified when either running a task or creating a new service.The memberOf task placement constraint places tasks on container instances that satisfy an expression.The memberOf task placement constraint can be specified with the following actions:• Running a task• Creating a new service• Creating a new task definition• Creating a new revision of an existing task definitionThe example JSON code uses the memberOf constraint to place tasks on instances in the databases task group. It can be specified with the following actions: CreateService, UpdateService, RegisterTaskDefinition, and RunTask.CORRECT: "They will be placed on container instances in the “databases” task group" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "They will become members of a task group called “databases”" is incorrect. They will be placed on container instances in the “databases” task group.INCORRECT: "They will not be placed on container instances in the “databases” task group" is incorrect. This statement ensures the tasks ARE placed on the container instances in the “databases” task group.INCORRECT: "They will not be allowed to run unless they have the “databases” tag assigned" is incorrect. This JSON code is not related to tagging of the tasks.References: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/taskplacementconstraints.html16:T821,When a task that uses the EC2 launch type is launched, Amazon ECS must determine where to place the task based on the requirements specified in the task definition, such as CPU and memory. Similarly, when you scale down the task count, Amazon ECS must determine which tasks to terminate. You can apply task placement strategies and constraints to customize how Amazon ECS places and terminates tasks. Task placement strategies and constraints are not supported for tasks using the Fargate launch type. By default, Fargate tasks are spread across Availability Zones.A task placement strategy is an algorithm for selecting instances for task placement or tasks for termination. For example, Amazon ECS can select instances at random, or it can select instances such that tasks are distributed evenly across a group of instances.Amazon ECS supports the following task placement strategies:• binpackPlace tasks based on the least available amount of CPU or memory. This minimizes the number of instances in use.• randomPlace tasks randomly.• spreadPlace tasks evenly based on the specified value. Accepted values are instanceId (or host, which has the same effect), or any platform or custom attribute that is applied to a container instance, such as attribute:ecs.availabilityzone. Service tasks are spread based on the tasks from that service. Standalone tasks are spread based on the tasks from the same task group.Therefore, for this scenario the random task placement strategy is most suitable as it requires the least configuration.CORRECT: "random" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "spread" is incorrect. As high availability is taken care of within the containers there is no need to use a spread strategy to ensure HA.INCORRECT: "binpack" is incorrect as there is no need to pack the containers onto the fewest instances based on CPU or memory.INCORRECT: "Fargate" is incorrect as this is not a task placement strategy, it is a serverless service for running containers.References: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/taskplacementstrategies.html17:T4d3,To ensure encryption between the origin (Amazon EC2) and CloudFront you need to set the Origin Protocol Policy to “HTTPS Only” This is configured in the origin settings and can be seen in the image below:To ensure encryption between CloudFront and the end users you need to change the Viewer Protocol Policy to “HTTPS Only” or “Redirect HTTP to HTTPS”. This is configured in the cache behavior and can be seen in the image below:CORRECT: "Set the Origin Protocol Policy to “HTTPS Only”" is the correct answer.CORRECT: "Set the Viewer Protocol Policy to “HTTPS Only” or “Redirect HTTP to HTTPS”" is also a correct answer.INCORRECT: "Enable Field Level Encryption" is incorrect. This is used to add another layer of security to sensitive data such as credit card numbers.INCORRECT: "Change the HTTP port to 443 in the Origin Settings" is incorrect. You should not change the HTTP port to 443, instead change Origin Protocol Policy to HTTPS.INCORRECT: "Use AWS KMS to enforce encryption" is incorrect. AWS KMS is not used for enforcing encryption on CloudFront. AWS KMS is used for creating and managing encryption keys.References: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/usinghttps.html18:T4ca,Weighted routing lets you associate multiple resources with a single domain name (example.com) or subdomain name (acme.example.com) and choose how much traffic is routed to each resource. This can be useful for a variety of purposes, including load balancing and testing new versions of software.In this case the Developer can use a weighted routing policy to direct 20% of the incoming traffic to the new site as required.CORRECT: "Use an Amazon Route 53 Weighted Routing Policy" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "Use an Amazon Route 53 Geolocation Routing Policy" is incorrect as the Developer should use a weighted routing policy for this requirement as a specified percentage of traffic needs to be directed to the new website.INCORRECT: "Use a blue/green deployment with Amazon Elastic Beanstalk" is incorrect as the question does not state that Elastic Beanstalk is being used and the new website has already been deployed.INCORRECT: "Use a blue/green deployment with Amazon CodeDeploy" is incorrect as the question does not state that Amazon CodeDeploy is being used and the website has already been deployed.References: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routingpolicy.html#routingpolicyweighted19:T4da,Amazon CloudWatch Events delivers a near realtime stream of system events that describe changes in Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources. Using simple rules that you can quickly set up, you can match events and route them to one or more target functions or streams.You can use Amazon CloudWatch Events to invoke the Lambda function on a recurring schedule of 15 minutes. This solution is entirely automated and serverless.CORRECT: "Create an Amazon CloudWatch Events rule that is scheduled to run and invoke the function" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "Launch an EC2 Linux instance and add a command to periodically invoke the function to its /etc/crontab file " is incorrect as this is automatic but it is not serverless.INCORRECT: "Configure the Lambda scheduler to run based on recurring time value" is incorrect as there is no Lambda scheduler that can be used.INCORRECT: "Create an Amazon SNS rule to send a notification to Lambda to instruct it to run" is incorrect as you cannot invoke a function by sending a notification to it from Amazon SNS.References: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/RunLambdaSchedule.html https://digitalcloud.training/certificationtraining/awsdeveloperassociate/awscompute/awslambda/1a:T7d7,Amazon Kinesis Data Streams supports changes to the data record retention period of your stream. A Kinesis data stream is an ordered sequence of data records meant to be written to and read from in real time. Data records are therefore stored in shards in your stream temporarily. The time period from when a record is added to when it is no longer accessible is called the retention period. A Kinesis data stream stores records from 24 hours by default, up to 168 hours.You can increase the retention period up to 168 hours using the IncreaseStreamRetentionPeriod operation. You can decrease the retention period down to a minimum of 24 hours using the DecreaseStreamRetentionPeriod operation. The request syntax for both operations includes the stream name and the retention period in hours. Finally, you can check the current retention period of a stream by calling the DescribeStream operation.Both operations are easy to use. The following is an example of changing the retention period using the AWS CLI:Therefore, the most likely explanation is that the message retention period is set at the 24hour default.CORRECT: "Records are retained for 24 hours in the Kinesis Data Stream by default" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "Amazon RedShift is not suitable for storing streaming data" is incorrect. In this architecture Amazon Kinesis is responsible for receiving streaming data and storing it in a stream. The EC2 instances can then process and store the data in a number of different destinations including Amazon RedShift.INCORRECT: "The EC2 instance is failing intermittently" is incorrect as the question states that a review of monitoring logs indicates that the EC2 instance is healthy. If it was failing intermittently this should be recorded in the logs.INCORRECT: "Amazon Kinesis has too many shards provisioned" is incorrect as this would just mean that the Kinesis Stream has more capacity, not less.References: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/kinesisextendedretention.html1b:T56c,In this case the Developer’s access keys may have been compromised so the first step would be to invalidate the access keys by deleting them.The next step would then be to determine if any temporary security credentials have been issued an invalidating those too to prevent any further misuse.The user account and user account password have not been compromised so they do not need to be deleted / changed as a first step. However, changing the account password would typically be recommended as a best practice in this situation.CORRECT: "Delete the compromised access keys" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "Delete her IAM user account" is incorrect. This user account has not been compromised based on the available information, just the access keys. Deleting the access keys will prevent further misuse of the AWS account.INCORRECT: "Report the incident to AWS Support" is incorrect is a good practice but not the first step. The Developer should first attempt to mitigate any further misuse of the account by deleting the access keys.INCORRECT: "Change her IAM User account password" is incorrect as she does not have any evidence that the account has been compromised, just the access keys. However, it would be a good practice to change the password, just not the first thing to do.References: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/whattodoifyouinadvertentlyexposeanawsaccesskey/1c:T6e4,You can create one or more aliases for your AWS Lambda function. A Lambda alias is like a pointer to a specific Lambda function version. Users can access the function version using the alias ARN.You can point an alias a multiple versions of your function code and then assign a weighting to direct certain amounts of traffic to each version. This enables a blue/green style of deployment and means it’s easy to roll back to the older version by simply updating the weighting if issues occur with user experience.CORRECT: "Create an alias and point it to the new and previous versions. Assign a weight of 20% to the new version to direct less traffic. Update the application code to point to the new alias" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "Create an alias and point it to the new version. Update the application code to point to the new alias" is incorrect as it is better to point the alias at both the new and previous versions of the function code so that it is easier to roll back with fewer application code changes.INCORRECT: "Update the application code to point to the new version" is incorrect as if you do this you will have to change the application code again to roll back in the event of issues. You will also need to update the application code every time you publish a new version, so this is not a best practice strategy.INCORRECT: "Create A records in Route 53 for each function version’s ARN. Use a weighted routing policy to direct 20% of traffic to the new version. Add the DNS records to the application code" is incorrect as you cannot create Route 53 DNS records that point to an ARN.References:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configurationaliases.html https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configurationversions.html1d:T4dd,The AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) is an opensource framework that you can use to build serverless applications on AWS. A serverless application is a combination of Lambda functions, event sources, and other resources that work together to perform tasks.AWS SAM provides you with a simple and clean syntax to describe the functions, APIs, permissions, configurations, and events that make up a serverless application.The AWS SAM CLI lets you locally build, test, and debug serverless applications that are defined by AWS SAM templates. The CLI provides a Lambdalike execution environment locally. It helps you catch issues upfront by providing parity with the actual Lambda execution environment.CORRECT: "AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM)" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "AWS CloudFormation" is incorrect as you cannot perform local build and test with AWS CloudFormation.INCORRECT: "AWS Elastic Beanstalk" is incorrect as you cannot deploy serverless applications or perform local build and test with Elastic Beanstalk.INCORRECT: "AWS CodeBuild" is incorrect as you cannot perform local build and test with AWS CodeBuild.References: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverlessapplicationmodel/latest/developerguide/whatissam.html1e:T5f9,The sam init command initializes a serverless application with an AWS SAM template. The template provides a folder structure for your Lambda functions and is connected to an event source such as APIs, S3 buckets, or DynamoDB tables. This application includes everything you need to get started and to eventually extend it into a productionscale application.This is the simplest way for the Developer to quickly get started with testing AWS SAM. Before the Developer can use the “sam” commands it is necessary to install the AWS SAM CLI. This is separate to the AWS CLI.CORRECT: "Install the AWS SAM CLI, run sam init and use one of the AWS Quick Start Templates" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "Install the AWS CLI, run aws sam init and use one of the AWS Quick Start Templates" is incorrect as “sam init” is not an AWS CLI command, therefore you cannot put “aws” in front of “sam”.INCORRECT: "Use the AWS Management Console to access AWS SAM and deploy a Hello World function" is incorrect as you cannot access AWS SAM through the console. You can, however, access the Serverless Application Repository through the console and deploy SAM templates.INCORRECT: "Use AWS CloudFormation to deploy a Hello World stack using AWS SAM" is incorrect as though AWS SAM does use CloudFormation you cannot deploy SAM templates through the AWS CloudFormation console. You must use the SAM CLI or deploy using the Serverless Application Repository.https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/package.html1f:T645,The permissions assigned to the user account are missing the privileges to create and delete branches in AWS CodeCommit.The Developer needs to be assigned these permissions but according to the principal of least privilege it’s important to ensure no additional permissions are assigned.The following API actions can be used to work with branches:• CreateBranch , which creates a branch in a specified repository.• DeleteBranch , which deletes the specified branch in a repository unless it is the default branch.• GetBranch , which returns information about a specified branch.• ListBranches , which lists all branches for a specified repository.• UpdateDefaultBranch , which changes the default branch for a repository.Therefore, the best answer is to add the “codecommit:CreateBranch” and “codecommit:DeleteBranch” permissions to the permissions policy.CORRECT: "codecommit:CreateBranch” and “codecommit:DeleteBranch" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "codecommit:Put*:" is incorrect. The wildcard (*) will allow any API action starting with “Put”, however the only options are putfile and putrepositorytriggers, neither of which is related to branches.INCORRECT: "codecommit:Update*" is incorrect. The wildcard (*) will allow any API action starting with “Update”, however none of the options available are suitable for working with branches.INCORRECT: "codecommit:*" is incorrect as this would allow any API action which does not follow the principal of least privilege.References: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/codecommit/index.html#cliawscodecommit20:T528,The company need to add security to their website by encrypting traffic intransit using HTTPS. This requires adding SSL/TLS certificates to enable the encryption. The process of encrypting and decrypting data is CPU intensive and therefore the company need to avoid adding certificates to the EC2 instances as that will place further load on their CPUs.Therefore, the solution is to configure SSL certificates on the Elastic Load Balancer and then configure SSL termination. This can be done by adding a certificate to a HTTPS listener on the load balancer.CORRECT: "Configure SSL certificates on an Elastic Load Balancer" is a correct answer.CORRECT: "Configure an Elastic Load Balancer with SSL termination" is a correct answer.INCORRECT: "Configure an Elastic Load Balancer with SSL passthrough" is incorrect as with passthrough the SSL session must be terminated on the EC2 instances which should be avoided as they are CPUconstrained.INCORRECT: "Configure an Elastic Load Balancer with a KMS CMK" is incorrect as a KMS CMK is used to encrypt data at rest, it is not used for intransit encryption.INCORRECT: "Install SSL certificates on the EC2 instances" is incorrect as this would increase the load on the CPUsReferences: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/createhttpslistener.html21:T50a,The AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) is an opensource framework for building serverless applications. It provides shorthand syntax to express functions, APIs, databases, and event source mappings. With just a few lines per resource, you can define the application you want and model it using YAML.The “Transform” header indicates that the developer is creating a SAM template as it has the value: Transform: 'AWS::Serverless20161031'Therefore there are two sets of commands that can be used to package and deploy using SAM:Use either:• sam package• sam deployOr use:• aws cloudformation package• aws cloudformation deployCORRECT: "sam package and sam deploy" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "sam package and sam build" is incorrect as “sam build” is used to build your Lambda function code, not to package and deploy it.INCORRECT: "aws cloudformation createstackset" is incorrect as this creates a stack set and is not used when deploying using AWS SAM.INCORRECT: "aws cloudformation package and aws cloudformation createstack" is incorrect as when using AWS SAM you should use “aws cloudformation deploy” instead for the second command.References: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverlessapplicationmodel/latest/developerguide/serverlesssamclicommandreference.html22:T5db,AWS Step Functions lets you coordinate multiple AWS services into serverless workflows so you can build and update apps quickly. Using Step Functions, you can design and run workflows that stitch together services, such as AWS Lambda, AWS Fargate, and Amazon SageMaker, into featurerich applications.Workflows are made up of a series of steps, with the output of one step acting as input into the next. Application development is simpler and more intuitive using Step Functions, because it translates your workflow into a state machine diagram that is easy to understand, easy to explain to others, and easy to change.Step Functions automatically triggers and tracks each step, and retries when there are errors, so your application executes in order and as expected. With Step Functions, you can craft longrunning workflows such as machine learning model training, report generation, and IT automation.Therefore, AWS Step Functions is the best AWS service to use when refactoring the application away from the legacy code.CORRECT: "AWS Step Functions" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "AWS CloudFormation" is incorrect as CloudFormation is used for deploying resources no AWS but not for ongoing automation.INCORRECT: "AWS CodePipeline" is incorrect as this is used as part of a continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipeline to deploy software updates to applications.INCORRECT: "AWS CodeBuild" is incorrect as this an AWS build/test service.References: https://aws.amazon.com/stepfunctions/23:T60b,Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between your client and an S3 bucket. Transfer Acceleration takes advantage of Amazon CloudFront’s globally distributed edge locations. As the data arrives at an edge location, data is routed to Amazon S3 over an optimized network path.You might want to use Transfer Acceleration on a bucket for various reasons, including the following:• You have customers that upload to a centralized bucket from all over the world.• You transfer gigabytes to terabytes of data on a regular basis across continents.• You are unable to utilize all of your available bandwidth over the Internet when uploading to Amazon S3.CORRECT: "Upload using Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "Upload to a local Amazon S3 bucket within each region and enable CrossRegion Replication (CRR)" is incorrect as this would not speed up the upload as the process introduces more latency.INCORRECT: "Upload via a managed AWS VPN connection" is incorrect as this still uses the public Internet and there’s no real latency advantages here.INCORRECT: "Upload to Amazon CloudFront and then download from the local cache to the S3 bucket" is incorrect. This is going to require some time to propagate to the cache and requires some manual work in retrieving the data. The simplest solution is to use S3 Transfer Acceleration which basically does this for you. References: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/transferacceleration.html24:T557,AWS Step Functions is a web service that enables you to coordinate the components of distributed applications and microservices using visual workflows. You build applications from individual components that each perform a discrete function, or task, allowing you to scale and change applications quickly.Step Functions provides a reliable way to coordinate components and step through the functions of your application. Step Functions offers a graphical console to visualize the components of your application as a series of steps. It automatically triggers and tracks each step, and retries when there are errors, so your application executes in order and as expected, every time. Step Functions logs the state of each step, so when things go wrong, you can diagnose and debug problems quickly.CORRECT: "AWS Step Functions" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "Amazon SWF" is incorrect. You can think of Amazon SWF as a fullymanaged state tracker and task coordinator in the Cloud. It does not coordinate serverless workflows.INCORRECT: "AWS Batch" is incorrect as this is used to run batch computing jobs on Amazon EC2 and is therefore not serverless.INCORRECT: "AWS Lambda" is incorrect as though it is serverless, it does not provide a native capability to coordinate multiple AWS services.References: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/stepfunctions/latest/dg/welcome.html25:T80a,The process of consuming messages from a queue depends on whether you use short or long polling. By default, Amazon SQS uses short polling, querying only a subset of its servers (based on a weighted random distribution) to determine whether any messages are available for a response. You can use long polling to reduce your costs while allowing your consumers to receive messages as soon as they arrive in the queue.When you consume messages from a queue using short polling, Amazon SQS samples a subset of its servers (based on a weighted random distribution) and returns messages from only those servers. Thus, a particular ReceiveMessage request might not return all of your messages. However, if you have fewer than 1,000 messages in your queue, a subsequent request will return your messages. If you keep consuming from your queues, Amazon SQS samples all of its servers, and you receive all of your messages.When the wait time for the ReceiveMessage API action is greater than 0, long polling is in effect. The maximum long polling wait time is 20 seconds. Long polling helps reduce the cost of using Amazon SQS by eliminating the number of empty responses (when there are no messages available for a ReceiveMessage request) and false empty responses (when messages are available but aren't included in a response)Therefore, the Developer should call the ReceiveMessage API with the WaitTimeSeconds parameter set to 20 to enable long polling.CORRECT: "Call the ReceiveMessage API with the WaitTimeSeconds parameter set to 20 " is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "Call the ReceiveMessage API with the VisibilityTimeout parameter set to 30" is incorrectINCORRECT: "Call the SetQueueAttributes API with the DelaySeconds parameter set to 900" is incorrectINCORRECT: "Call the SetQueueAttributes API with the maxReceiveCount set to 20" is incorrectReferences:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqsshortandlongpolling.html https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_SetQueueAttributes.html26:T641,AWS CloudFormation StackSets extends the functionality of stacks by enabling you to create, update, or delete stacks across multiple accounts and regions with a single operation.Using an administrator account, you define and manage an AWS CloudFormation template, and use the template as the basis for provisioning stacks into selected target accounts across specified regions.Using StackSets for this scenario will work well and result in the least operational overhead in creating, updating and deleting CloudFormation stacks across multiple accounts.CORRECT: "Create a CloudFormation Stack in an administrator account and use StackSets to update the stacks across multiple accounts" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "Create a CloudFormation Stack in an administrator account and use CloudFormation Change Sets to modify stacks across multiple accounts" is incorrect. Change sets allow you to preview how proposed changes to a stack might impact your running resources.INCORRECT: "Migrate the application into an Elastic Beanstalk environment that is shared between multiple accounts" is incorrect because we don’t even know if the application is compatible with Elastic Beanstalk and you cannot “share” environments between multiple accounts.INCORRECT: "Synchronize the applications in multiple accounts using AWS AppSync" is incorrect. AWS AppSync can perform synchronization and realtime updates between applications but it requires development and is not suitable for solving this challenge.References: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/whatiscfnstacksets.html27:T562,The simplest option is to add the script to the user data when creating the launch configuration. User data is information that is parsed when the EC2 instances are launched. When you add a script to the user data in a launch configuration all instances that are launched by that Auto Scaling group will run the script.CORRECT: "Add the script to the user data when creating the launch configuration" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "Configure Amazon CloudWatch Events to trigger the AWS CLI when an instance is launched and run the script" is incorrect as you cannot trigger the AWS CLI using CloudWatch Events and the script may not involve AWS CLI commands.INCORRECT: "Package the script in a zip file with some AWS Lambda source code. Upload to Lambda and run the function when instances are launched" is incorrect as Lambda does not run shell scripts. You could program the requirements into the function code however you still need a trigger which is not mentioned in this option.INCORRECT: "Run the script using the AWS Systems Manager Run Command" is incorrect as this is not the simplest method. For most Linux AMIs (except Amazon Linux) the developer’s would need to install the agent on the operating system. They would also then need to create a mechanism of triggering the run command.References: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/userdata.html28:T786,AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store provides secure, hierarchical storage for configuration data management and secrets management. You can store data such as passwords, database strings, and license codes as parameter values.You can store values as plaintext (unencrypted data) or ciphertext (encrypted data). You can then reference values by using the unique name that you specified when you created the parameter.A secure string parameter is any sensitive data that needs to be stored and referenced in a secure manner. If you have data that you don't want users to alter or reference in plaintext, such as passwords or license keys, create those parameters using the SecureString datatype.If you choose the SecureString datatype when you create a parameter, then Parameter Store uses an AWS Key Management Service (KMS) customer master key (CMK) to encrypt the parameter value.This is the most secure and operationally efficient way to meet this requirement. The connection string will be encrypted and only needs to be managed in one place where it can be shared by the multiple Lambda functions.CORRECT: "Create a secure string parameter using AWS systems manage parameter store" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "Use KMS encrypted environment variables within each Lambda function" is incorrect as this would require more operational overhead when managing any changes to the connection string.INCORRECT: "Use a CloudHSM encrypted environment variable that is shared between the functions" is incorrect as you cannot encrypt Lambda environment variables with CloudHSM (use KMS instead).INCORRECT: "Embed the connection string within the Lambda function code" is incorrect as this is not secure or operationally efficient.References:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systemsmanager/latest/userguide/systemsmanagerparameterstore.html https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systemsmanager/latest/userguide/sysmanparamstoresecurestring.html29:T625,At the Amazon S3 bucket level, you can configure permissions through a bucket policy. For example, you can limit access to the objects in a bucket by IP address range or specific IP addresses. Alternatively, you can make the objects accessible only through HTTPS.The following bucket policy allows access to Amazon S3 objects only through HTTPS (the policy was generated with the AWS Policy Generator).Here the bucket policy explicitly denies ("Effect": "Deny") all read access ("Action": "s3:GetObject") from anybody who browses("Principal": "*") to Amazon S3 objects within an Amazon S3 bucket if they are not accessed through HTTPS("aws:SecureTransport": "false").CORRECT: "Create an S3 bucket policy that denies traffic where SecureTransport is false" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "Create an S3 bucket policy that denies traffic where SecureTransport is true" is incorrect. This will not work as it is denying traffic that IS encrypted in transit.INCORRECT: "Create an S3 bucket policy that denies any S3 Put request that does not include the xamzserversideencryption" is incorrect. This will ensure that the data is encrypted at rest, but not intransit.INCORRECT: "Configure HTTP to HTTPS redirection on the Elastic Load Balancer" is incorrect. This will ensure the client traffic reaching the ELB is encrypted however we need to ensure the traffic from the EC2 instances to S3 is encrypted and the ELB is not involved in this communication.References: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/howtousebucketpoliciesandapplydefenseindepthtohelpsecureyouramazons3data/2a:T4b7,AWS KMS establishes quotas for the number of API operations requested in each second. When you exceed an API request quota, AWS KMS throttles the request, that is, it rejects an otherwise valid request and returns a ThrottlingException error. As the error indicates, one of the recommendations is to reduce the frequency of calls which can be implemented by using exponential backoff logic in the application code. It is also possible to contact AWS and request an increase in the quota. CORRECT: "Contact AWS support to request an AWS KMS rate limit increase" is a correct answer. CORRECT: "Perform error retries with exponential backoff in the application code" is a correct answer. INCORRECT: "Contact AWS support to request an S3 rate limit increase" is incorrect as the error indicates throttling in AWS KMS. INCORRECT: "Import a customer master key (CMK) with a larger key size" is incorrect as the key size does not affect the quota for requests to AWS KMS. INCORRECT: "Use more than once customer master key (CMK) to encrypt S3 data" is incorrect as the issue is not the CMK it is the request quota on AWS KMS. References: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/requestspersecond.html2b:T5d5,Concurrency is the number of requests that your function is serving at any given time. When your function is invoked, Lambda allocates an instance of it to process the event. When the function code finishes running, it can handle another request. If the function is invoked again while a request is still being processed, another instance is allocated, which increases the function's concurrency.In this scenario the Lambda function will be invoked 40 times per second and run for 100 seconds. Therefore, there can be up to 4,000 executions running concurrently which is above the default perregion limit of 1,000 concurrent executions.This can be easily rectified by contacting AWS support and requesting the concurrent execution limit to be increased.CORRECT: "Contact AWS Support to increase the concurrent execution limits" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "Implement error handling within the function code" is incorrect. Though this could be useful it is not something that must be done based on what we know about this scenario.INCORRECT: "Implement a Dead Letter Queue to capture invocation errors" is incorrect as this would be implemented for message handling requirements.INCORRECT: "Implement tracing with XRay" is incorrect. XRay can be used to analyze and debug distributed applications. We don’t know of any specific issues with this function yet so this is not something that must be done.References: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configurationconcurrency.html2c:T5a3,The content in the 'hooks' section of the AppSpec file varies, depending on the compute platform for your deployment.The 'hooks' section for an EC2/OnPremises deployment contains mappings that link deployment lifecycle event hooks to one or more scripts.The 'hooks' section for a Lambda or an Amazon ECS deployment specifies Lambda validation functions to run during a deployment lifecycle event. If an event hook is not present, no operation is executed for that event. This section is required only if you are running scripts or Lambda validation functions as part of the deployment.Therefore, in this scenario a valid structure for the order of hooks that should be specified in the appspec.yml file is:BeforeInstall > AfterInstall > AfterAllowTestTraffic > BeforeAllowTraffic > AfterAllowTrafficCORRECT: "BeforeInstall > AfterInstall > AfterAllowTestTraffic > BeforeAllowTraffic > AfterAllowTraffic" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "BeforeInstall > AfterInstall > ApplicationStart > ValidateService" is incorrect as this would be valid for Amazon EC2.INCORRECT: "BeforeAllowTraffic > AfterAllowTraffic" is incorrect as this would be valid for AWS Lambda.INCORRECT: "BeforeBlockTraffic > AfterBlockTraffic > BeforeAllowTraffic > AfterAllowTraffic" is incorrect as this is a partial listing of hooks for Amazon EC2 but is incomplete.References: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/referenceappspecfilestructurehooks.html2d:T6de,Implementing error retries and exponential backoff is a good way to resolve this issue. Exponential backoff can improve an application's reliability by using progressively longer waits between retries. If you're using an AWS SDK, this logic is builtin. If you're not using an AWS SDK, consider manually implementing exponential backoff.Additional options for preventing throttling from occurring include:• Distribute read and write operations as evenly as possible across your table. A hot partition can degrade the overall performance of your table. For more information, see Designing Partition Keys to Distribute Your Workload Evenly.• Implement a caching solution. If your workload is mostly read access to static data, then query results can be delivered much faster if the data is in a welldesigned cache rather than in a database. DynamoDB Accelerator(DAX) is a caching service that offers fast inmemory performance for your application. You can also use Amazon ElastiCache.CORRECT: "Add exponential backoff to the application logic" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "Use Amazon SQS as an API message bus" is incorrect. SQS is used for decoupling (messages, nut not APIs), however for this scenario it would add extra cost and complexity.INCORRECT: "Pass API calls through Amazon API Gateway" is incorrect. For this scenario we don’t want to add an additional layer in when we can simply configure the application to back off and retry.INCORRECT: "Send the items to DynamoDB through Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose" is incorrect as DynamoDB is not a supported destination for Kinesis Data Firehose.References:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/apiretries.html https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledgecenter/dynamodbtablethrottled/2e:T50e,The Query operation finds items based on primary key values. You can query any table or secondary index that has a composite primary key (a partition key and a sort key).For items up to 4 KB in size, one RCU equals one strongly consistent read request per second or two eventually consistent read requests per second. Therefore, using eventually consistent reads uses fewer RCUs.CORRECT: "Query operation using eventuallyconsistent reads" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "Query operation using stronglyconsistent reads" is incorrect as stronglyconsistent reads use more RCUs than eventually consistent reads.INCORRECT: "Scan operation using eventuallyconsistent reads" is incorrect. The Scan operation returns one or more items and item attributes by accessing every item in a table or a secondary index and therefore uses more RCUs than a query operation.INCORRECT: "Scan operation using stronglyconsistent reads" is incorrect. The Scan operation returns one or more items and item attributes by accessing every item in a table or a secondary index and therefore uses more RCUs than a query operation.References:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_Query.html https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.ReadWriteCapacityMode.html2f:T4ad,The BatchGetItem operation returns the attributes of one or more items from one or more tables. You identify requested items by primary key.A single operation can retrieve up to 16 MB of data, which can contain as many as 100 items. In order to minimize response latency, BatchGetItem retrieves items in parallel.By default, BatchGetItem performs eventually consistent reads on every table in the request. If you want strongly consistent reads instead, you can set ConsistentRead to true for any or all tables.CORRECT: "Use BatchGetItem" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "Use GetItem and use a projection expression" is incorrect as this will limit the attributes returned and will retrieve the items sequentially which results in more latency.INCORRECT: "Use a Scan operation with pagination" is incorrect as a Scan operation is the least efficient way to retrieve the data as all items in the table are returned and then filtered. Pagination just breaks the results into pages.INCORRECT: "Use a Query operation with a FilterExpression" is incorrect as this would limit the results that are returned.References: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_BatchGetItem.html30:T7a1,You can use CloudWatch Logs to monitor applications and systems using log data. For example, CloudWatch Logs can track the number of errors that occur in your application logs and send you a notification whenever the rate of errors exceeds a threshold you specify.CloudWatch Logs uses your log data for monitoring; so, no code changes are required. For example, you can monitor application logs for specific literal terms (such as "NullReferenceException") or count the number of occurrences of a literal term at a particular position in log data (such as "404" status codes in an Apache access log).When the term you are searching for is found, CloudWatch Logs reports the data to a CloudWatch metric that you specify. Log data is encrypted while in transit and while it is at rest.CORRECT: "Use CloudWatch Logs to track the number of errors that occur in the application logs and send an SNS notification" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "Use CloudTrail to monitor the application log files and send an SNS notification" is incorrect as CloudTrail logs API activity in your account, it does not monitor application logs.INCORRECT: "Configure the application to send logs to Amazon S3. Use Amazon Kinesis Analytics to analyze the log files and send an SES notification" is incorrect. This is a much more complex solution and is not a full solution as it does not include a method of loading the data into Kinesis. Amazon SES is also not suitable for notifications, SNS should be used which can also send emails if required.INCORRECT: "Configure Amazon CloudWatch Events to monitor the EC2 instances and configure an SNS topic as a target" is incorrect as it monitors AWS services for changes in state. You can monitor EC2, but not the application within the EC2 instance.References:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/WhatIsCloudWatchLogs.html https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/WhatIsCloudWatchEvents.html31:T604,This should be implemented using a role in the Production account and a group in the Development account. The developer in the Development account would then be added to the group. The role in the Production account would provide the necessary access and would allow the group in the Development account to assume the role.Therefore, the most secure way to achieve the required access is to use a role in the Production account that the user is able to assume and then the user can request shortlived credentials from the Security Token Service (STS).CORRECT: "Create a crossaccount access role, and use sts:AssumeRole API to get shortlived credentials" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "Generate an access key on the second account using the root account and share the access keys with the developer for API access" is incorrect as this is highly insecure. You should never share access keys across user accounts, and you should especially not use access keys associated with the root account.INCORRECT: "Add the user to a group in the second account that has a role attached granting the necessary permissions" is incorrect as you cannot add a user to a group in a different AWS account.INCORRECT: "Use AWS KMS to generate crossaccount customer master keys and use those get shortlived credentials" is incorrect as you do not use AWS KMS CMKs for obtaining shortlived credentials from the STS service. CMKs are used for encrypting data.References: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_commonscenarios_awsaccounts.html32:T5de,When you invoke a function synchronously, Lambda runs the function and waits for a response. When the function execution ends, Lambda returns the response from the function's code with additional data, such as the version of the function that was executed. To invoke a function synchronously with the AWS CLI, use the invoke command.The following diagram shows clients invoking a Lambda function synchronously. Lambda sends the events directly to the function and sends the function's response back to the invoker.We know the function has been run synchronously as the invocationtype Event parameter has not been included. Also, the status code 200 indicates a successful execution of a synchronous execution.CORRECT: "An AWS Lambda function has been invoked synchronously and has completed successfully" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "An AWS Lambda function has been invoked synchronously and has not completed successfully" is incorrect as the status code 200 indicates a successful execution.INCORRECT: "An AWS Lambda function has been invoked asynchronously and has completed successfully" is incorrect as the invocationtype Event has parameter is not included so this is not an asynchronous invocation.INCORRECT: "An AWS Lambda function has been invoked asynchronously and has not completed successfully" is incorrect as the invocationtype Event has parameter is not included so this is not an asynchronous invocation.References: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocationsync.html33:T690,With Destinations, you can send asynchronous function execution results to a destination resource without writing code. A function execution result includes version, timestamp, request context, request payload, response context, and response payload. For each execution status (i.e. Success and Failure), you can choose one destination from four options: another Lambda function, an SNS topic, an SQS standard queue, or EventBridge.For this scenario, the code will be run by Lambda and the execution result will then be sent to the SNS topic. The application that is subscribed to the SNS topics will then receive the notification.CORRECT: "Configure a Lambda “on success” destination and route the execution results to Amazon SNS" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "Configure a CloudWatch Events alarm the triggers based on Lambda execution success and route the execution results to Amazon SNS" is incorrect as CloudWatch Events is used to track changes in the state of AWS resources. To forward execution results from Lambda a destination should be used.INCORRECT: "Configure a Lambda “on success” destination and route the execution results to Amazon SQS" is incorrect as SQS is a message queue not a pub/sub notification service.INCORRECT: "Configure a CloudWatch Events alarm the triggers based on Lambda execution success and route the execution results to Amazon SQS" is incorrect as CloudWatch Events is used to track changes in the state of AWS resources. To forward execution results from Lambda a destination should be used (with an SNS topic).References: https://aws.amazon.com/aboutaws/whatsnew/2019/11/awslambdasupportsdestinationsforasynchronousinvocations/34:T776,AWS Lambda automatically monitors Lambda functions on your behalf, reporting metrics through Amazon CloudWatch. To help you troubleshoot failures in a function, Lambda logs all requests handled by your function and also automatically stores logs generated by your code through Amazon CloudWatch Logs.Lambda automatically integrates with CloudWatch Logs and pushes all logs from your code to a CloudWatch Logs group associated with a Lambda function, which is named /aws/lambda/.An AWS Lambda function's execution role grants it permission to access AWS services and resources. You provide this role when you create a function, and Lambda assumes the role when your function is invoked. You can create an execution role for development that has permission to send logs to Amazon CloudWatch and upload trace data to AWS XRay.The most likely cause of this issue is that the execution role assigned to the Lambda function does not have the permissions (shown above) to write to CloudWatch Logs.CORRECT: "The execution role for the Lambda function is missing permissions to write log data to the CloudWatch Logs" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "The Lambda function does not have any explicit log statements for the log data to send it to CloudWatch Logs" is incorrect as this is not required, Lambda automatically logs data to CloudWatch logs and just needs the permissions to do so.INCORRECT: "The Lambda function is missing a target CloudWatch Logs group" is incorrect as the CloudWatch Logs group will be created automatically if the function has sufficient permissions.INCORRECT: "The Lambda function is missing CloudWatch Logs as a source trigger to send log data" is incorrect as CloudWatch Logs is a destination, not a source in this case. However, you do not need to configure CloudWatch Logs as a destination, it is automatic.References: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambdamonitoring.html35:T648,Metrics produced by AWS services are standard resolution by default. When you publish a custom metric, you can define it as either standard resolution or high resolution. When you publish a highresolution metric, CloudWatch stores it with a resolution of 1 second, and you can read and retrieve it with a period of 1 second, 5 seconds, 10 seconds, 30 seconds, or any multiple of 60 seconds.User activity is not a standard CloudWatch metric and as stated above for the resolution we need in this scenario a custom CloudWatch metric is required anyway. Therefore, for this scenario the Developer should create a highresolution custom Amazon CloudWatch metric for user activity data and publish the data every 5 seconds.CORRECT: "Create a highresolution custom Amazon CloudWatch metric for user activity data, then publish data every 5 seconds" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "Create a highresolution custom Amazon CloudWatch metric for user activity data, then publish data every 30 seconds" is incorrect as the resolution is lower than required which will not provide the granularity required.INCORRECT: "Create a standardresolution custom Amazon CloudWatch metric for user activity data, then publish data every 30 seconds" is incorrect as standard resolution metrics have a granularity of one minute.INCORRECT: "Create a standardresolution custom Amazon CloudWatch metric for user activity data, then publish data every 5 seconds" is incorrect as standard resolution metrics have a granularity of one minute.References: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/publishingMetrics.html36:T6e6,You can use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to monitor, store, and access your log files from Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, AWS CloudTrail, Route 53, and other sources.CloudWatch Logs enables you to centralize the logs from all of your systems, applications, and AWS services that you use, in a single, highly scalable service. You can then easily view them, search them for specific error codes or patterns, filter them based on specific fields, or archive them securely for future analysis.To collect logs from Amazon EC2 and onpremises instances it is necessary to install an agent. There are two options: the unified CloudWatch Agent which collects logs and advanced metrics (such as memory usage), or the older CloudWatch Logs agent which only collects logs from Linux servers.CORRECT: "Install the Amazon CloudWatch Logs agent and collect the logs from the instances" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "Create a script that copies the log files to Amazon S3 and use a cron job to run the script on a recurring schedule" is incorrect as the best place to move the log files to for querying and long term retention would be CloudWatch Logs. It is also easier to use the agent than to create and maintain a script.INCORRECT: "Create a script that uses the AWS SDK to collect and send the log files to Amazon CloudWatch Logs" is incorrect as this is not the easiest way to achieve this outcome. It will be easier to use the CloudWatch Logs agent.INCORRECT: "Setup a CloudWatch Events rule to trigger an SNS topic when an application log file is generated" is incorrect as CloudWatch Events does not collect log files, it monitors state changes in resources.References: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/WhatIsCloudWatchLogs.html37:T5fc,When Amazon S3 objects are private, only the object owner has permission to access these objects. However, the object owner can optionally share objects with others by creating a presigned URL, using their own security credentials, to grant timelimited permission to download the objects.When you create a presigned URL for your object, you must provide your security credentials, specify a bucket name, an object key, specify the HTTP method (GET to download the object) and expiration date and time. The presigned URLs are valid only for the specified duration.Anyone who receives the presigned URL can then access the object. In this scenario, the photos can be shared with the owner’s website but not with any other 3rd parties. This will stop other sites from linking to the photos as they will not display anywhere else.CORRECT: "Remove public read access and use signed URLs with expiry dates" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "Store photos on an EBS volume of the web server" is incorrect as this does not add any more control over content visibility in the website.INCORRECT: "Use CloudFront distributions for static content" is incorrect as this alone will not protect the content. You can also use presigned URLs with CloudFront, but this isn’t mentioned.INCORRECT: "Block the IPs of the offending websites in Security Groups" is incorrect as you can only configure allow rules in security groups so this would be hard to manage.References: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ShareObjectPreSignedURL.html38:T7cb,Amazon Kinesis Data Streams (KDS) is a massively scalable and durable realtime data streaming service. KDS can continuously capture gigabytes of data per second from hundreds of thousands of sources such as website clickstreams, database event streams, financial transactions, social media feeds, IT logs, and locationtracking events. KDS receives data from producers, and the data is stored in shards. Consumers then take the data and process it. In this case the AWS Lambda function is consuming the records from the shards.In this scenario an application will be producing records and placing them in the stream as in step 1 of the image below. The AWS Lambda function will then consume the records (step 2) and will then execute the function by assuming the execution role specified (step 3).A shard is an appendonly log and a unit of streaming capability. A shard contains an ordered sequence of records ordered by arrival time. The order is guaranteed within a shard but not across shards.Therefore, the best answer to this question is that AWS Lambda will receive each record in the exact order it was placed into the shard but there is no guarantee of order across shardsCORRECT: "Lambda will receive each record in the exact order it was placed into the shard. There is no guarantee of order across shards" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "Lambda will receive each record in the exact order it was placed into the stream " is incorrect as there are multiple shards in the stream and the order of records is not guaranteed across shards.INCORRECT: "Lambda will receive each record in the reverse order it was placed into the stream" is incorrect as the order is guaranteed within a shard.INCORRECT: "The Developer can select exact order or reverse order using the GetRecords API" is incorrect as you cannot choose the order you receive records with the GetRecords API.References:https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/datastreams/gettingstarted/ https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/datastreams/faqs/39:T48b,When you need to update a stack, understanding how your changes will affect running resources before you implement them can help you update stacks with confidence. Change sets allow you to preview how proposed changes to a stack might impact your running resources.AWS CloudFormation makes the changes to your stack only when you decide to execute the change set, allowing you to decide whether to proceed with your proposed changes or explore other changes by creating another change set. You can create and manage change sets using the AWS CloudFormation console, AWS CLI, or AWS CloudFormation API.CORRECT: "Create a Change Set" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "Create a StackSet" is incorrect as StackSets are used to create, update, or delete stacks across multiple accounts and regions with a single operation.INCORRECT: "Use drift detection" is incorrect as this is used to detect when a configuration deviates from the template configuration.INCORRECT: "Use a direct update" is incorrect as this will directly update the production resources.References: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/usingcfnupdatingstackschangesets.html3a:T655,Service control policies (SCPs) are one type of policy that you can use to manage your organization. SCPs offer central control over the maximum available permissions for all accounts in your organization, allowing you to ensure your accounts stay within your organization’s access control guidelines.You can configure the SCPs in your organization to work as either of the following:• A deny list – actions are allowed by default, and you specify what services and actions are prohibited• An allow list – actions are prohibited by default, and you specify what services and actions are allowedAs there are only a few API actions to restrict the most efficient strategy for this scenario is to create a deny list and specify the specific actions that are prohibited.CORRECT: "Create a deny list and specify the API actions to deny" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "Create an allow list and specify the API actions to deny" is incorrect as with an allow list you specify the API actions to allow.INCORRECT: "Create an IAM policy that denies the API actions for all users and roles" is incorrect as you cannot create deny policies in IAM. IAM policies implicitly deny access unless you explicitly allow permissions.INCORRECT: "Create an IAM policy that allows only the unrestricted API actions" is incorrect. This will not work for administrative users such as the root account (as they have extra permissions) so an SCP must be used.References:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scp.html https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/SCP_strategies.html3b:T801,A user pool is a user directory in Amazon Cognito. With a user pool, your users can sign in to your web or mobile app through Amazon Cognito. Your users can also sign in through social identity providers like Google, Facebook, Amazon, or Apple, and through SAML identity providers.User pools provide:• Signup and signin services.• A builtin, customizable web UI to sign in users.• Social signin with Facebook, Google, Login with Amazon, and Sign in with Apple, as well as signin with SAML identity providers from your user pool.• User directory management and user profiles.• Security features such as multifactor authentication (MFA), checks for compromised credentials, account takeover protection, and phone and email verification.• Customized workflows and user migration through AWS Lambda triggers.Multifactor authentication (MFA) increases security for your app by adding another authentication method, and not relying solely on username and password. You can choose to use SMS text messages, or timebased onetime (TOTP) passwords as second factors in signing in your users.For this scenario you would want to set the MFA setting to “Required” as the data is highly secure.CORRECT: "Amazon Cognito User Pool with MFA" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "Amazon Cognito Identity Pool with MFA" is incorrectINCORRECT: "AWS IAM with MFA" is incorrect. With IAM your user accounts are maintained in your AWS account rather than in a Cognito User Pool. For logging into a web or mobile app it is better to create and manage your users in a Cognito User Pool and add MFA to the User Pool for extra security.INCORRECT: "AWS Directory Service" is incorrect as this is a managed Active Directory service. For a web or mobile application using AWS Cognito User Pools is a better solution for storing your user accounts and authenticating to the application.References:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognitouseridentitypools.html https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/userpoolsettingsmfa.html3c:T53c,With Destinations, you can route asynchronous function results as an execution record to a destination resource without writing additional code. An execution record contains details about the request and response in JSON format including version, timestamp, request context, request payload, response context, and response payload.For each execution status such as Success or Failure you can choose one of four destinations: another Lambda function, SNS, SQS, or EventBridge. Lambda can also be configured to route different execution results to different destinations.In this scenario the Developer can publish the processed data to an Amazon SNS topic by configuring an Amazon SNS topic as an onfailure destination.CORRECT: "Configure an Amazon SNS topic as an onfailure destination" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "Separate the Lambda handler from the core logic" is incorrect as this will not assist with sending a notification to administrators.INCORRECT: "Use Amazon CloudWatch Events to send the processed data" is incorrect as CloudWatch Events is used for tracking state changes, not forwarding execution resultsINCORRECT: "Push the failed records to an Amazon SQS queue" is incorrect as SQS will not notify the administrators, SNS should be used.References: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/introducingawslambdadestinations/3d:T688,Amazon DynamoDB provides fast access to items in a table by specifying primary key values. However, many applications might benefit from having one or more secondary (or alternate) keys available, to allow efficient access to data with attributes other than the primary key. To address this, you can create one or more secondary indexes on a table and issue Query or Scan requests against these indexes.A secondary index is a data structure that contains a subset of attributes from a table, along with an alternate key to support Query operations. You can retrieve data from the index using a Query, in much the same way as you use Query with a table. A table can have multiple secondary indexes, which give your applications access to many different query patterns.You can also issue scan operations on a global secondary index however it is less efficient as it will return all items in the index.CORRECT: "Query operation using eventuallyconsistent reads" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "Query operation using stronglyconsistent reads" is incorrect. Strongly consistent reads require more RCUs and also are not supported on a global secondary index (they are supported on local secondary indexes).INCORRECT: "Scan operation using eventuallyconsistent reads" is incorrect as a scan is less efficient than a query and will therefore use more RCUs.INCORRECT: "Scan operation using stronglyconsistent reads" is incorrect as a scan is less efficient than a query and will therefore use more RCUs.References:https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/SecondaryIndexes.html https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/GSI.html3e:T837,You use AWS WAF to control how an Amazon CloudFront distribution, an Amazon API Gateway API, or an Application Load Balancer responds to web requests.• Web ACLs – You use a web access control list (ACL) to protect a set of AWS resources. You create a web ACL and define its protection strategy by adding rules. Rules define criteria for inspecting web requests and specify how tohandle requests that match the criteria. You set a default action for the web ACL that indicates whether to block or allow through those requests that pass the rules inspections.• Rules – Each rule contains a statement that defines the inspection criteria, and an action to take if a web request meets the criteria. When a web request meets the criteria, that's a match. You can use rules to block matchingrequests or to allow matching requests through. You can also use rules just to count matching requests.• Rules groups – You can use rules individually or in reusable rule groups. AWS Managed Rules and AWS Marketplace sellers provide managed rule groups for your use. You can also define your own rule groups.After you create your web ACL, you can associate it with one or more AWS resources. The resource types that you can protect using AWS WAF web ACLs are Amazon CloudFront distributions, Amazon API Gateway APIs, and Application Load Balancers.CORRECT: "Add a rule to a Web ACL using AWS WAF that denies the IP address ranges" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "Create a security group rule denying the address range and apply it to the EC2 instances" is incorrect as you cannot add deny rules to security groups.INCORRECT: "Add a certificate using AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) and encrypt all communications" is incorrect as this will not prevent attacks from coming in from the specific IP ranges. This will simply enabled SSL/TLS for communications from clients.INCORRECT: "Disable the Amazon CloudFront distribution and then reenable it" is incorrect as this will do nothing to stop future attacks from occurring.References: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/howawswafworks.html3f:T603,AWS CodeStar enables you to quickly develop, build, and deploy applications on AWS. AWS CodeStar provides a unified user interface, enabling you to easily manage your software development activities in one place. With AWS CodeStar, you can set up your entire continuous delivery toolchain in minutes, allowing you to start releasing code faster. AWS CodeStar makes it easy for your whole team to work together securely, allowing you to easily manage access and add owners, contributors, and viewers to your projects.Each AWS CodeStar project comes with a project management dashboard, including an integrated issue tracking capability powered by Atlassian JIRA Software. With the AWS CodeStar project dashboard, you can easily track progress across your entire software development process, from your backlog of work items to teams’ recent code deployments.CORRECT: "AWS CodeStar" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "AWS CodePipeline" is incorrect as it does not offer the collaboration and project management dashboard features of CodeStar.INCORRECT: "AWS Cloud9" is incorrect as it is a cloudbased integrated development environment (IDE) that lets you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser.INCORRECT: "AWS CodeCommit" is incorrect. CodeCommit is a fully managed source control service that hosts Gitbased repositories. However, it does not offer the collaboration and project management dashboard features of CodeStar or the preconfigured continuous delivery toolchain.References: https://aws.amazon.com/codestar/features/40:T539,You can create one or more aliases for your AWS Lambda function. A Lambda alias is like a pointer to a specific Lambda function version. Users can access the function version using the alias ARN.This is the best way to setup the Lambda function so you don’t need to modify the application code when a new version is published. Instead, the developer will simply need to update the Alias to point to the new version:As you can see above you can also point to multiple versions and send a percentage of traffic to each. This is great for testing new code.CORRECT: "Setup an Alias that will point to the latest version" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "Publish a mutable version and point it to the $LATEST version" is incorrect as all published versions are immutable (cannot be modified) and you cannot modify a published version to point to the $LATEST version.INCORRECT: "Use an unqualified ARN" is incorrect as this is an ARN that does not have a version number which means it points to the $LATEST version, not to a published version (as published versions always have version numbers).INCORRECT: "Setup a Route 53 Alias record that points to the published version" is incorrect as you cannot point a Route 53 Alias record to an AWS Lambda function.References: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configurationaliases.html41:T7c6,The key requirements in this scenario are to add fault tolerances and elasticity to the web tier and application tier. Note that no specific requirements for the back end have been included.To add elasticity to the web and application tiers the Developer should create Auto Scaling groups of EC2 instances. We know that the application tier runs on Linux and the web tier runs on Apache Tomcat (which could be on Linux or Windows).Therefore, these workloads are suitable for an ASG and this will ensure the number of instances dynamically scales out and in based on actual usage.To add fault tolerance to the web and application tiers the Developer should add an Elastic Load Balancer. This will ensure that if the number of EC2 instances are changed by the ASG, the load balancer is able to distribute traffic to them. This also assists with elasticity.CORRECT: "Create an Auto Scaling group of EC2 instances for both the web tier and application tier" is a correct answer.CORRECT: "Implement an Elastic Load Balancer for both the web tier and the application tier" is also a correct answer.INCORRECT: "Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution for the web tier" is incorrect as CloudFront is used for performance reasons, not elasticity or fault tolerance. You would use CloudFront to get content closer to end users around the world.INCORRECT: "Use a multiAZ Amazon RDS database for the back end using the MySQL engine" is incorrect as the question does not ask for fault tolerance of the back end, only the web tier and the application tier.INCORRECT: "Implement an Elastic Load Balancer for the application tier" is incorrect. An Elastic Load Balancer should be implemented for both the web tier and the application tier as that is how we ensure fault tolerance and elasticity for both of those tiers.References:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide/whatisloadbalancing.html https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/serviceautoscaling.html42:T61d,The GetItem operation returns a set of attributes for the item with the given primary key. If there is no matching item, GetItem does not return any data and there will be no Item element in the response.PutItem creates a new item or replaces an old item with a new item. If an item that has the same primary key as the new item already exists in the specified table, the new item completely replaces the existing item.UpdateItem edits an existing item's attributes or adds a new item to the table if it does not already exist. You can put, delete, or add attribute values. You can also perform a conditional update on an existing item (insert a new attribute namevalue pair if it doesn't exist or replace an existing namevalue pair if it has certain expected attribute values).CORRECT: "GetItem, PutItem, UpdateItem" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "GetItem, TransactWriteItems, UpdateTable" is incorrect as TransactWriteItems is a synchronous write operation that groups up to 25 action requests. In this scenario we are updating individual items.INCORRECT: "GetItem, PutItem, DeleteItem" is incorrect as DeleteItem will delete single items in a table by primary key. We do not want to delete, we want to modify so UpdateItem should be used instead.INCORRECT: "BatchGetItem, BatchWriteItem, UpdateItem" is incorrect as BatchGetItem and BatchGetItem are used when you have multiple items to read/write. In this scenario we are updating individual items.References: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_Operations_Amazon_DynamoDB.html43:T595,AWS CodeCommit is a version control service hosted by Amazon Web Services that you can use to privately store and manage assets (such as documents, source code, and binary files) in the cloud.A repository is the fundamental version control object in CodeCommit. It's where you securely store code and files for your project. It also stores your project history, from the first commit through the latest changes. You can share your repository with other users so you can work together on a project. If you add AWS tags to repositories, you can set up notifications so that repository users receive email about events (for example, another user commenting on code).You can also change the default settings for your repository, browse its contents, and more. You can create triggers for your repository so that code pushes or other events trigger actions, such as emails or code functions. You can even configure a repository on your local computer (a local repo) to push your changes to more than one repository.CORRECT: "AWS CodeCommit" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "Subversion" is incorrect as this is not a fully managed source control systemINCORRECT: "AWS CodeBuild" is incorrect as this is a service used for building and testing code.INCORRECT: "AWS CodeStar" is incorrect as this is not a source control system; it integrates with source control systems such as CodeCommit.References: https://aws.amazon.com/codecommit/44:Tb63,The UpdateShardCount API action updates the shard count of the specified stream to the specified number of shards. Updating the shard count is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving the request, Kinesis Data Streams returns immediately and sets the status of the stream to UPDATING. After the update is complete, Kinesis Data Streams sets the status of the stream back to ACTIVE.Depending on the size of the stream, the scaling action could take a few minutes to complete. You can continue to read and write data to your stream while its status is UPDATING.To update the shard count, Kinesis Data Streams performs splits or merges on individual shards. This can cause shortlived shards to be created, in addition to the final shards. These shortlived shards count towards your total shard limit for your account in the Region.When using this operation, we recommend that you specify a target shard count that is a multiple of 25% (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%). You can specify any target value within your shard limit. However, if you specify a target that isn't a multiple of 25%, the scaling action might take longer to complete.This operation has the following default limits. By default, you cannot do the following:• Scale more than ten times per rolling 24hour period per stream• Scale up to more than double your current shard count for a stream• Scale down below half your current shard count for a stream• Scale up to more than 500 shards in a stream• Scale a stream with more than 500 shards down unless the result is less than 500 shards• Scale up to more than the shard limit for your accountNote that the question specifically states that the Kinesis data stream cannot keep up with incoming data. This indicates that the producers are attempting to add records to the stream but there are not enough shards to keep up with demand.Therefore, we need to add additional shards and can do this using the UpdateShardCount API action.CORRECT: "Increase the shard count of the stream using UpdateShardCount" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "Install the Kinesis Producer Library (KPL) for ingesting data into the stream" is incorrect as that will help the producers to be more efficient and increase write throughput to a Kinesis data stream. However, this will not help as the Kinesis data stream already cannot keep up with the incoming demand.INCORRECT: "Create an SQS queue and decouple the producers from the Kinesis data stream " is incorrect. You cannot decouple a Kinesis producer from a Kinesis data stream using SQS. Kinesis is more than capable of keeping up with demand, it just needs more shards in this case.INCORRECT: "Ingest multiple records into the stream in a single call using PutRecords" is incorrect as the stream is already overloaded, we need more shards, not more data to be written.References: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateShardCount.html45:T471,To connect to AWS services from a private subnet with no internet access, use VPC endpoints. A VPC endpoint for DynamoDB enables resources in a VPC to use their private IP addresses to access DynamoDB with no exposure to the public internet.When you create a VPC endpoint for DynamoDB, any requests to a DynamoDB endpoint within the Region (for example, dynamodb.uswest2.amazonaws.com) are routed to a private DynamoDB endpoint within the Amazon network.CORRECT: "Configure a VPC endpoint" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "Attach an Internet Gateway" is incorrect as you do not attach these to a private subnet.INCORRECT: "Create a route table" is incorrect as a route table will exist for all subnets and it does not help to route out from a private subnet via the Internet unless an entry for a NAT Gateway or Instance is added.INCORRECT: "Attach an ENI to the DynamoDB table" is incorrect as you do not attach Elastic Network Interfaces to DynamoDB tables.References:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/troubleshootingnetworking.html https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/vpcendpointsdynamodb.html46:T492,Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. APIs act as the "front door" for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your backend services.Using API Gateway, you can create RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs that enable realtime twoway communication applications. API Gateway supports containerized and serverless workloads, as well as web applications.API Gateway can be used as the single interface for consumers of the services provided by the organization in this scenario. This solution will simplify the architecture.CORRECT: "Amazon API Gateway" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "AWS XRay" is incorrect. AWS XRay is used for analyzing and debugging applications.INCORRECT: "AWS Cognito" is incorrect. AWS Cognito is used for adding signup, signin and access control to web and mobile apps.INCORRECT: "AWS Single Sign On (SSO)" is incorrect. AWS SSO is used to provide central management of multiple AWS accounts and business applications and to provide single signon to accounts.References: https://aws.amazon.com/apigateway/features/47:T6ae,Amazon CloudWatch Events delivers a near realtime stream of system events that describe changes in Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources. Using simple rules that you can quickly set up, you can match events and route them to one or more target functions or streams. CloudWatch Events becomes aware of operational changes as they occur. CloudWatch Events responds to these operational changes and takes corrective action as necessary, by sending messages to respond to the environment, activating functions, making changes, and capturing state information.In this scenario the only workable solution is to create a CloudWatch Event with an event pattern looking for EC2 state changes and a target set to use the Lambda function.CORRECT: "Create a CloudWatch Event with an event pattern looking for EC2 state changes and a target set to use the Lambda function" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "Create a CloudWatch alarm that triggers the Lambda function based on log streams indicating an EC2 state change in CloudWatch logs" is incorrect as Amazon EC2 does not create a log group or log stream by default.INCORRECT: "Create a CloudTrail trail alarm that triggers the Lambda function based on the RunInstances API action" is incorrect as you would need to create a CloudWatch alarm for CloudTrail events (CloudTrail does not have its own alarm feature).INCORRECT: "Configure detailed monitoring on Amazon EC2 and create an alarm that triggers the Lambda function in initialization" is incorrect as you cannot trigger a Lambda function on EC2 instances initialization using detailed monitoring (or the EC2 console).References: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/WhatIsCloudWatchEvents.html48:Tbc1,By default, the Scan operation processes data sequentially. Amazon DynamoDB returns data to the application in 1 MB increments, and an application performs additional Scan operations to retrieve the next 1 MB of data.The larger the table or index being scanned, the more time the Scan takes to complete. In addition, a sequential Scan might not always be able to fully use the provisioned read throughput capacity: Even though DynamoDB distributes a large table's data across multiple physical partitions, a Scan operation can only read one partition at a time. For this reason, the throughput of a Scan is constrained by the maximum throughput of a single partition.To address these issues, the Scan operation can logically divide a table or secondary index into multiple segments, with multiple application workers scanning the segments in parallel. Each worker can be a thread (in programming languages that support multithreading) or an operating system process. To perform a parallel scan, each worker issues its own Scan request with the following parameters:• Segment — A segment to be scanned by a particular worker. Each worker should use a different value for Segment.• TotalSegments — The total number of segments for the parallel scan. This value must be the same as the number of workers that your application will use.The following diagram shows how a multithreaded application performs a parallel Scan with three degrees of parallelism.To make the most of your table’s provisioned throughput, you’ll want to use the Parallel Scan API operation so that your scan is distributed across your table’s partitions. However, you also need to ensure the scan doesn’t consume your table’s provisioned throughput and cause the critical parts of your application to be throttled.To control the amount of data returned per request, use the Limit parameter. This can help prevent situations where one worker consumes all of the provisioned throughput, at the expense of all other workers.Therefore, the best solution to this problem is to use a parallel scan API operation with the Limit parameter.CORRECT: "Use a Parallel Scan API operation " is the correct answer.CORRECT: "Use the Limit parameter" is also a correct answer.INCORRECT: "Use a Sequential Scan API operation" is incorrect as this would take more time and the question requests that we minimize the time it takes to complete the scan.INCORRECT: "Increase read capacity units during the scan operation" is incorrect as this would increase cost and we still need a solution to ensure we maximize usage of available throughput without affecting production workloads.INCORRECT: "Use pagination to divide results into 1 MB pages" is incorrect as this does only divides the results into pages, it does not segment and limit the amount of throughput used.References:https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/ratelimitedscansinamazondynamodb/ https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Scan.html#Scan.ParallelScan49:T524,Typically, when you use the KCL, you should ensure that the number of instances does not exceed the number of shards (except for failure standby purposes). Each shard is processed by exactly one KCL worker and has exactly one corresponding record processor, so you never need multiple instances to process one shard. However, one worker can process any number of shards, so it's fine if the number of shards exceeds the number of instances.In this scenario, the number of shards has been increased to 8. Therefore, the maximum number of instances that can be deployed is 8 as the number of instances cannot exceed the number of shards.CORRECT: "8" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "6" is incorrect as this is not the maximum number of instances that can be deployed to process 8 shards. The maximum number of instances should be the same as the number of shards.INCORRECT: "12" is incorrect as the number of instances exceeds the number of shards. You should ensure that the number of instances does not exceed the number of shardsINCORRECT: "1" is incorrect as this is not the maximum number of instances that can be deployed to process 8 shards. The maximum number of instances should be the same as the number of shards.References: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/kinesisrecordprocessorscaling.html4a:T616,A DynamoDB stream is an ordered flow of information about changes to items in a DynamoDB table. When you enable a stream on a table, DynamoDB captures information about every modification to data items in the table.Whenever an application creates, updates, or deletes items in the table, DynamoDB Streams writes a stream record with the primary key attributes of the items that were modified. A stream record contains information about a data modification to a single item in a DynamoDB table. You can configure the stream so that the stream records capture additional information, such as the "before" and "after" images of modified items.This is the best way to capture a record of new changes made to the DynamoDB table. Another table can then be populated with this data so the data is stored persistently.CORRECT: "Use Amazon DynamoDB streams" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "Use CloudWatch events" is incorrect. CloudWatch Events delivers a near realtime stream of system events that describe changes in Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources. However, it does not capture the information that changes in a DynamoDB table so is unsuitable for this purpose.INCORRECT: "Use Amazon CloudTrail" is incorrect as CloudTrail records a history of API calls on your account. It is used for creating an audit trail of events.INCORRECT: "Use Amazon DynamoDB snapshots" is incorrect as snapshots only capture a point in time, they are not used for recording itemlevel changes.References: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Streams.html4b:T496,The client can then be used with put_file which adds or updates a file in a branch in an AWS CodeCommit repository, and generates a commit for the addition in the specified branch.The request syntax is as follows:CORRECT: "Use an AWS SDK to instantiate a CodeCommit client. Invoke the put_file method to add the file to the repository" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "When the Lambda function starts, use the Git CLI to clone the repository. Check the new file into the cloned repository and push the change" is incorrect as there is no need to clone a repository, a file just needs to be added to an existing repository.INCORRECT: "After the new file is created in Lambda, use cURL to invoke the CodeCommit API. Send the file to the repository" is incorrect as a URL cannot be used to invoke a CodeCommit client and upload and check in the file.INCORRECT: "Upload the new file to an Amazon S3 bucket. Create an AWS Step Function to accept S3 events. In the Step Function, add the new file to the repository" is incorrect as Step Functions is not triggered by S3 events.References: https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/codecommit.html4c:T542,Delay queues let you postpone the delivery of new messages to a queue for a number of seconds, for example, when your consumer application needs additional time to process messages.If you create a delay queue, any messages that you send to the queue remain invisible to consumers for the duration of the delay period. The default (minimum) delay for a queue is 0 seconds. The maximum is 15 minutes.Therefore, the correct explanation is that with an Amazon SQS Delay Queue messages are hidden for a configurable amount of time when they are first added to the queueCORRECT: "Messages are hidden for a configurable amount of time when they are first added to the queue" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "Messages are hidden for a configurable amount of time after they are consumed from the queue" is incorrect. They are hidden when they are added to the queue.INCORRECT: "The consumer can poll the queue for a configurable amount of time before retrieving a message" is incorrect. A delay queue simply delays visibility of the message, it does not affect polling behavior.INCORRECT: "Message cannot be deleted for a configurable amount of time after they are consumed from the queue" is incorrect. That is what a visibility timeout achieves.References: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqsdelayqueues.html4d:T768,AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed build service in the cloud. CodeBuild compiles your source code, runs unit tests, and produces artifacts that are ready to deploy. CodeBuild eliminates the need to provision, manage, and scale your own build servers. It provides prepackaged build environments for popular programming languages and build tools such as Apache Maven, Gradle, and more.You can also customize build environments in CodeBuild to use your own build tools. CodeBuild scales automatically to meet peak build requests.CodeBuild provides these benefits:• Fully managed – CodeBuild eliminates the need to set up, patch, update, and manage your own build servers.• On demand – CodeBuild scales on demand to meet your build needs. You pay only for the number of build minutes you consume.• Out of the box – CodeBuild provides preconfigured build environments for the most popular programming languages.All you need to do is point to your build script to start your first build.Therefore, AWS CodeBuild is the best service to use to compile the Development team’s source code, run tests, and produce software packages that are ready for deployment.CORRECT: "AWS CodeBuild" is the correct answer.INCORRECT: "AWS CodeCommit" is incorrect. The team are already using CodeCommit for its correct purpose, which is to manage source code.
